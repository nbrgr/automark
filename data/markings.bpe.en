Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grand@@ mother , Mam@@ ar , in our four-@@ family home in Bro@@ o@@ kl@@ yn , New York .
Her apartment was an oasis .
It was a place where I could s@@ ne@@ ak a cup of coffee , which was really warm milk with just a touch of c@@ aff@@ eine .
She loved life .
And although she worked in a factory , she saved her pen@@ ni@@ es and she travel@@ ed to Europe .
And I remember por@@ ing over those pictures with her and then dan@@ cing with her to her favorite music .
And then , when I was eight and she was 60 , something changed .
She no longer worked or travel@@ ed .
She no longer dan@@ ced .
There were no more coffee times .
My mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn 't make a diagnosis .
And my father , who worked at night , would spend every afternoon with her , just to make sure she ate .
Her care became all-@@ consu@@ ming for our family .
And by the time a diagnosis was made , she was in a deep spir@@ al .
Now many of you will recognize her symptoms .
My grand@@ mother had de@@ pression .
A deep , life-@@ alter@@ ing de@@ pression , from which she never recovered .
And back then , so little was known about de@@ pression .
But even today , 50 years later , there 's still so much more to learn .
Today , we know that women are 70 percent more likely to experience de@@ pression over their life@@ times compared with men .
And even with this high pre@@ val@@ ence , women are mis@@ diagno@@ sed between 30 and 50 percent of the time .
Now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms of f@@ ati@@ gue , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , pain and anxi@@ ety compared with men .
And these symptoms are often over@@ looked as symptoms of de@@ pression .
And it isn 't only de@@ pression in which these sex differences occur , but they occur across so many diseases .
So it 's my grand@@ mother 's stru@@ gg@@ les that have really led me on a lifelong quest .
And today , I lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women .
Today , we know that every cell has a sex .
Now , that 's a term co@@ ined by the Institute of Medic@@ ine .
And what it means is that men and women are different down to the cell@@ ular and mole@@ cular levels .
It means that we 're different across all of our organs .
From our bra@@ ins to our hearts , our lung@@ s , our jo@@ ints .
Now , it was only 20 years ago that we hardly had any data on women 's health beyond our re@@ productive functions .
But then in 1993 , the NI@@ H Re@@ v@@ itali@@ zation Act was signed into law .
And what this law did was it mand@@ ated that women and minorities be included in clinical trials that were funded by the National In@@ stitutes of Health .
And in many ways , the law has worked .
Women are now rout@@ inely included in clinical studies , and we 've learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease .
But remark@@ ably , what we have learned about these differences is often over@@ looked .
So , we have to ask ourselves the question : Why leave women 's health to chance ?
And we 're leaving it to chance in two ways .
The first is that there is so much more to learn and we 're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences .
And the second is that we aren 't taking what we have learned , and rout@@ inely applying it in clinical care .
We are just not doing enough .
So , I 'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have imp@@ acted the health of women , and where we need to do more .
Let 's start with heart disease .
When I was nine years old , my mo@@ m asked me what I would want my house to look like , and I drew this fair@@ y mus@@ h@@ room .
And then she actually built it .
I don 't think I realized this was so unusual at the time , and maybe I still haven 't , because I 'm still designing houses .
This is a six-@@ story bes@@ po@@ ke home on the island of Bali .
It 's built almost entirely from b@@ am@@ bo@@ o .
The living room over@@ looks the valley from the fourth floor .
You enter the house by a bridge .
It can get hot in the trop@@ ics , so we make big cur@@ ving roo@@ fs to catch the bre@@ e@@ zes .
But some rooms have t@@ all windows to keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out .
This room we left open .
We made an air-conditioned , t@@ ented bed .
And one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room .
Bo@@ x@@ ing off an area with t@@ all walls just didn 't feel right , so instead , we made this giant wo@@ ven po@@ d .
Now , we do have all the necessary lux@@ uries , like bathrooms .
This one is a bas@@ ket in the corner of the living room , and I 've got tell you , some people actually hesitate to use it .
We have not quite fig@@ ured out our acou@@ stic insul@@ ation .
So there are lots of things that we 're still working on , but one thing I have learned is that b@@ am@@ bo@@ o will treat you well if you use it right .
It 's actually a wild grass .
It gro@@ ws on otherwise un@@ productive land -- deep ra@@ v@@ ines , mountain@@ sides .
It lives off of rain@@ water , spring water , sun@@ light , and of the 1,@@ 450 species of b@@ am@@ bo@@ o that grow across the world , we use just seven of them .
That 's my dad .
He 's the one who got me building with b@@ am@@ bo@@ o , and he is standing in a cl@@ ump of D@@ end@@ ro@@ cal@@ am@@ us as@@ per ni@@ ger that he plan@@ ted just seven years ago .
Each year , it sends up a new generation of shoo@@ ts .
That shoo@@ t , we wat@@ ched it grow a meter in three days just last week , so we 're talking about sustainable timber in three years .
Now , we har@@ vest from hundreds of family-@@ owned cl@@ um@@ ps .
Bet@@ ung , as we call it , it 's really long , up to 18 meters of us@@ able length .
T@@ ry getting that tru@@ ck down the mountain .
And it 's strong : it has the ten@@ si@@ le strength of steel , the compres@@ sive strength of concrete .
S@@ lam four tons straight down on a pole , and it can take it .
Because it 's hol@@ low , it 's ligh@@ tw@@ eight , light enough to be li@@ fted by just a few men , or , apparently , one woman .
And when my father built Green School in Bali , he chose b@@ am@@ bo@@ o for all of the buildings on camp@@ us , because he saw it as a promise .
But there are still some unique tra@@ its .
I mean , why would you want to do all these things for real ?
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning ; the protein is bio@@ degra@@ dable and bio@@ compatible .
And you see here a picture of a tissue section .
And so what does that mean , that it 's bio@@ degra@@ dable and bio@@ compatible ?
You can im@@ plant it in the body without nee@@ ding to retri@@ eve what is im@@ plan@@ ted .
Which means that all the devices that you 've seen before and all the formats , in principle , can be im@@ plan@@ ted and disappear .
And what you see there in that tissue section , in fact , is you see that reflec@@ tor tape .
So , much like you 're seen at night by a car , then the idea is that you can see , if you ill@@ umin@@ ate tissue , you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflec@@ tive tape there that is made out of sil@@ k .
And you see there , it gets re@@ integrated in tissue .
And re@@ integration in the human body is not the only thing , but re@@ integration in the environment is important .
So you have a clock , you have protein , and now a sil@@ k cup like this can be thrown away without guil@@ t -- unlike the pol@@ yst@@ y@@ ren@@ e cu@@ ps that unfortunately fill our land@@ f@@ ills everyday .
It 's edi@@ ble , so you can do smart packaging around food that you can co@@ ok with the food .
It doesn 't taste good , so I 'm going to need some help with that .
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle .
Sil@@ k , during its self-@@ assembly process , acts like a co@@ co@@ on for biological matter .
And so if you change the recip@@ e , and you add things when you pour -- so you add things to your liquid sil@@ k solution -- where these things are enz@@ y@@ mes or anti@@ bodies or vacc@@ ines , the self-@@ assembly process pre@@ serves the biological function of these d@@ op@@ ants .
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive .
So that scre@@ w that you thought about be@@ fore@@ hand can actually be used to scre@@ w a bone together -- a fra@@ c@@ tured bone together -- and deliver drugs at the same , while your bone is healing , for example .
Or you could put drugs in your wal@@ let and not in your fridge .
So we 've made a sil@@ k card with pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in in it .
And we stored pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in at 60 degrees C , so 140 degrees Fahr@@ enheit , for two months without loss of eff@@ ic@@ acy of the pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
And so that could be --@@ - that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refriger@@ ated cam@@ els . And of course , there 's no use in storage if you can 't use [ it ] .
And so there is this other unique material tra@@ it that these materials have , that they 're programm@@ ably degra@@ dable .
And so what you see there is the difference .
In the top , you have a film that has been programm@@ ed not to de@@ grade , and in the bottom , a film that has been programm@@ ed to de@@ grade in water .
And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it .
So it allows for the recovery of what we 've stored before .
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for re@@ integration in the environment in all of these formats that you 've seen .
So the thre@@ ad of discovery that we have really is a thre@@ ad .
We 're im@@ passion@@ ed with this idea that whatever you want to do , whether you want to replace a v@@ ein or a bone , or maybe be more sustainable in micro@@ electronics , perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guil@@ t , maybe carry your drugs in your po@@ cket , deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert , the answer may be in a thre@@ ad of sil@@ k .
Now , I mentioned that there are two definitions of re@@ wil@@ ding that interest me .
The other one is the re@@ wil@@ ding of human life .
And I don 't see this as an alternative to civili@@ zation .
I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology , as we 're doing now , but at the same time , if we choose , have access to a ri@@ cher and wil@@ der life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful , re@@ wil@@ ded habit@@ ats .
And the opportunities for this are developing more rapidly than you might think possible .
There 's one estimate which suggests that in the United States , two thirds of the land which was once fore@@ sted and then cleared has become re@@ fore@@ sted as log@@ gers and farmers have re@@ treated , particularly from the eastern half of the country .
There 's another one which suggests that 30 million hectares of land in Europe , an area the size of Poland , will be vac@@ ated by farmers between 2000 and 2030 .
Now , faced with opportunities like that , does it not seem a little un@@ ambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wol@@ ves , l@@ yn@@ x , bears , be@@ a@@ vers , b@@ ison , bo@@ ar , mo@@ ose , and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across Europe ?
Perhaps we should also start thinking about the return of some of our lost me@@ g@@ af@@ a@@ una .
What me@@ g@@ af@@ a@@ una , you say ?
Well , every continent had one , apart from An@@ tar@@ c@@ tica .
When Tra@@ fal@@ gar Square in London was exc@@ av@@ ated , the river gra@@ vels there were found to be stu@@ ff@@ ed with the b@@ ones of hi@@ p@@ po@@ pot@@ am@@ us , r@@ hin@@ os , el@@ ep@@ han@@ ts , hy@@ en@@ as , li@@ ons .
Yes , ladies and gentlemen , there were li@@ ons in Tra@@ fal@@ gar Square long before N@@ elson 's Col@@ umn was built .
All these species lived here in the last inter@@ gl@@ aci@@ al period , when temperatures were pretty similar to our own .
It 's not climate , largely , which has got rid of the world 's me@@ g@@ af@@ a@@ un@@ as .
It 's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habit@@ ats which has done so .
And even so , you can still see the sha@@ dows of these great be@@ asts in our current eco@@ systems .
Why is it that so many deci@@ du@@ ous trees are able to s@@ pro@@ ut from whatever point the tr@@ unk is broken ?
Why is it that they can with@@ stand the loss of so much of their bar@@ k ?
Why do under@@ story trees , which are subject to lower she@@ er forces from the wind and have to carry less weight than the big can@@ op@@ y trees , why are they so much tou@@ gher and harder to break than the can@@ op@@ y trees are ?
Ele@@ ph@@ ants .
They are el@@ eph@@ ant@@ -@@ adapted .
In Europe , for example , they evol@@ ved to resist the stra@@ igh@@ t-@@ t@@ us@@ ked el@@ eph@@ ant , el@@ ep@@ has anti@@ qu@@ us , which was a great be@@ ast .
It was related to the Asian el@@ eph@@ ant , but it was a tem@@ per@@ ate animal , a tem@@ per@@ ate forest creature .
It was a lot bigger than the Asian el@@ eph@@ ant .
But why is it that some of our common shr@@ ub@@ s have sp@@ ines which seem to be over-@@ engine@@ ered to resist brow@@ sing by de@@ er ?
Perhaps because they evol@@ ved to resist brow@@ sing by r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
Is@@ n 't it an amazing thought that every time you wan@@ der into a park or down an a@@ venue or through a le@@ af@@ y street , you can see the sha@@ dows of these great be@@ asts ?
Pal@@ eo@@ ec@@ ology , the study of past eco@@ systems , crucial to an understanding of our own , feels like a portal through which you may pass into an enchan@@ ted king@@ dom .
And if we really are looking at areas of land of the sort of sizes I 've been talking about becoming available , why not re@@ introduce some of our lost me@@ g@@ af@@ a@@ una , or at least species closely related to those which have become ext@@ inc@@ t everywhere ?
Why sh@@ ouldn 't all of us have a Ser@@ en@@ get@@ i on our door@@ steps ?
And perhaps this is the most important thing that re@@ wil@@ ding offers us , the most important thing that 's missing from our lives : hope .
In motiv@@ ating people to love and defend the natural world , an ounce of hope is worth a ton of des@@ pair .
The story re@@ wil@@ ding tells us is that ecological change need not always proceed in one direction .
It offers us the hope that our silent spring could be replaced by a rau@@ c@@ ous summer .
I am a H@@ az@@ ara , and the hom@@ eland of my people is Afghanistan .
Like hundreds of thousands of other H@@ az@@ ara kids , I was born in ex@@ ile .
The ongoing persecution and operation against the H@@ az@@ ar@@ as forced my parents to leave Afghanistan .
This persecution has had a long history going back to the late 18@@ 00@@ s , and the rule of King Ab@@ du@@ r Rah@@ man .
He killed 63 percent of the H@@ az@@ ara population .
He built min@@ are@@ ts with their heads .
Many H@@ az@@ ar@@ as were sold into sla@@ very , and many others fl@@ ed the country for neighbor@@ ing Iran and Pakistan .
My parents also fl@@ ed to Pakistan , and settled in Qu@@ etta , where I was born .
After the September 11 attack on the T@@ win To@@ wers , I got a chance to go to Afghanistan for the first time , with foreign journalists .
I was only 18 , and I got a job working as an interpre@@ ter .
After four years , I felt it was safe enough to move to Afghanistan permanently , and I was working there as a docu@@ mentary photograph@@ er , and I worked on many stories .
One of the most important stories that I did was the dan@@ cing boys of Afghanistan .
It is a tragic story about an app@@ alling tradition .
It involves young kids dan@@ cing for war@@ l@@ ords and powerful men in the society .
These boys are often ab@@ duc@@ ted or bought from their poor parents , and they are put to work as sex sla@@ ves .
This is Sh@@ u@@ k@@ ur .
He was kid@@ n@@ apped from Kab@@ ul by a war@@ l@@ ord .
He was taken to another province , where he was forced to work as a sex sla@@ ve for the war@@ l@@ ord and his friends .
When this story was published in the Washington Post , I started receiving death threats , and I was forced to leave Afghanistan , as my parents were .
Along with my family , I returned back to Qu@@ etta .
The situation in Qu@@ etta had changed dramatically since I left in 2005 .
Once a peaceful haven for the H@@ az@@ ar@@ as , it had now turned into the most dangerous city in Pakistan .
H@@ az@@ ar@@ as are confined into two small areas , and they are margin@@ alized socially , educ@@ ation@@ ally , and financially .
This is Na@@ dir .
I had known him since my childhood .
He was injured when his van was am@@ b@@ ush@@ ed by terrorists in Qu@@ etta .
He later died of his in@@ juries .
Around 1,@@ 600 H@@ az@@ ara members had been killed in various attacks , and around 3@@ ,000 of them were injured , and many of them permanently disabled .
The attacks on the H@@ az@@ ara community would only get worse , so it was not surprising that many wanted to fle@@ e .
After Afghanistan , Iran , Pakistan , Australia is home to the fourth largest population of H@@ az@@ ar@@ as in the world .
When it came time to leave Pakistan , Australia seemed the obvious choice .
For much of the past century , architecture was under the spell of a famous doc@@ tr@@ ine .
" Form follows function " had become modern@@ ity 's ambitious manifest@@ o and detri@@ mental stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et , as it liber@@ ated architecture from the decor@@ ative , but condemned it to uti@@ lit@@ arian rig@@ or and restra@@ ined purpose .
Of course , architecture is about function , but I want to remember a re@@ writing of this phrase by Bern@@ ard Tsch@@ um@@ i , and I want to propose a completely different quality .
If form follows fic@@ tion , we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories -- stories of the people that live there , of the people that work in these buildings .
And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create .
In this sense , I 'm interested in fic@@ tion not as the im@@ plau@@ sible but as the real , as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it .
Our buildings are proto@@ types , ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different , and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today .
Our buildings are real ; they 're being built .
They 're an explicit engagement in physical reality and concep@@ tual possibility .
I think of our architecture as organiz@@ ational structures .
At their core is indeed structural thinking , like a system : How can we arrange things in both a functional and experi@@ ential way ?
How can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and nar@@ rati@@ ves ?
And how can fic@@ tive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture , while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time ?
And here comes the second term into play , what I call " nar@@ r@@ ative hybri@@ ds " -- structures of multiple simultane@@ ous stories that un@@ fold throughout the buildings we create .
So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships , both in a programm@@ atic and functional way and in an experi@@ ential and emo@@ tive or social way .
This is the headquarters for China 's national broadcast@@ er , which I designed together with R@@ em Ko@@ ol@@ ha@@ as at OM@@ A .
When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002 , the city plann@@ ers showed us this image : a forest of several hundred sky@@ sc@@ rap@@ ers to emerge in the central business district , except at that time , only a hand@@ ful of them existed .
So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about , except one thing : it would all be about ver@@ tic@@ ality .
Of course , the sky@@ scra@@ per is vertical -- it 's a pro@@ found@@ ly hierarch@@ ical structure , the top always the best , the bottom the worst , and the t@@ aller you are , the better , so it seems .
And we wanted to ask ourselves , could a building be about a completely different quality ?
Could it und@@ o this hierarch@@ y , and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration , rather than isolation ?
So we took this need@@ le and b@@ ent it back into itself , into a loo@@ p of inter@@ connected activities .
Our idea was to bring all aspects of tel@@ ev@@ isi@@ on-@@ making into one single structure : news , program production , broadcasting , research and training , administration -- all into a circuit of inter@@ connected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration .
I still very much like this image .
It remin@@ ds one of bi@@ ology classes , if you remember the human body with all its organs and circul@@ atory systems , like at school .
And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance , but as an organis@@ m , as a life form .
And as you start to dis@@ sec@@ t this organis@@ m , you can identify a series of primary technical clu@@ sters -- program production , broadcasting center and news .
Those are tigh@@ tly inter@@ tw@@ ined with social clu@@ sters : meeting rooms , can@@ te@@ ens , chat areas -- informal spaces for people to meet and exchange .
So the organiz@@ ational structure of this building was a hybri@@ d between the technical and the social , the human and the perform@@ ative .
And of course , we used the loo@@ p of the building as a circul@@ atory system , to thre@@ ad everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity .
With 4@@ 7@@ 3@@ ,000 square meters , it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world .
It has a population of over 10,000 people , and of course , this is a scale that exceeds the comprehen@@ sion of many things and the scale of typical architecture .
So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut 10,000 little sti@@ cks and glu@@ ed them onto a model , just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant .
But of course , it 's not a number , it is the people , it is a community that inhab@@ its the building , and in order to both compreh@@ end this , but also script this architecture , we identified five characters , hypo@@ theti@@ cal characters , and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building , thought of where they would meet , what they would experience .
So it was a way to script and design the building , but of course , also to communicate its experiences .
This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art in both New York and Beijing .
However , at the next inter@@ val , the researchers didn 't put the cold air on , yet the sli@@ me m@@ old s@@ lowed down in anticip@@ ation of it happening .
It som@@ ehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn 't like .
The conclusion from their experiment was that the sli@@ me m@@ old was able to learn .
A third experiment : the sli@@ me m@@ old was invited to explore a territory covered in o@@ ats .
It fans out in a bran@@ ching pattern .
As it goes , each food no@@ de it finds , it forms a network , a connection to , and keeps for@@ aging .
After 26 hours , it established quite a firm network between the different o@@ ats .
Now there 's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center o@@ at that it started from represents the city of Tokyo , and the surrounding o@@ ats are sub@@ urban railway stations .
The sli@@ me m@@ old had rep@@ lic@@ ated the Tokyo transport network - - a complex system developed over time by community d@@ well@@ ings , civil engineering , urban planning .
What had taken us well over 100 years took the sli@@ me m@@ old just over a day .
The conclusion from their experiment was that the sli@@ me m@@ old can form efficient networks and solve the travel@@ ing sal@@ es@@ man problem .
It is a biological computer .
As such , it has been ma@@ them@@ atically model@@ ed , algorith@@ m@@ ically analy@@ zed .
It 's been son@@ i@@ fied , rep@@ lic@@ ated , simul@@ ated .
World over , teams of researchers are de@@ coding its biological principles to understand its comp@@ ut@@ ational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics , programming and ro@@ bo@@ tics .
So the question is , how does this thing work ?
It doesn 't have a central ner@@ vous system .
It doesn 't have a brain , yet it can perform behavi@@ ors that we associ@@ ate with brain function .
It can learn , it can remember , it can solve problems , it can make decisions .
So where does that intelligence lie ?
So this is a micro@@ scop@@ y , a video I shot , and it 's about 100 times magnific@@ ation , sp@@ ed up about 20 times , and inside the sli@@ me m@@ old , there is a rhyth@@ mic pul@@ sing flow , a v@@ ein-@@ like structure carrying cell@@ ular material , nutri@@ ents and chemical information through the cell , streaming first in one direction and then back in another .
And it is this continuous , synchron@@ ous o@@ sc@@ ill@@ ation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment , but without any large-scale control center .
This is where its intelligence lies .
So it 's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organis@@ m .
A few years ago , I set up Sli@@ Mo@@ Co , the Sli@@ me M@@ ould Colle@@ c@@ tive .
It 's an online , open , democratic network for sli@@ me m@@ old researchers and enthusi@@ asts to share knowledge and experi@@ mentation across disciplinary divi@@ des and across academic divi@@ des .
The Sli@@ me M@@ ould Colle@@ c@@ tive membership is self-@@ selecting .
People have found the collective as the sli@@ me m@@ old finds the o@@ ats .
And it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and researchers but also artists like me , architects , designers , writers , activists , you name it .
It 's a very interesting , ec@@ lec@@ tic membership .
Just a few examples : an artist who pa@@ ints with flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent Phy@@ sar@@ um ; a collabor@@ ative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3D printing technologies in a workshop ; another artist who is using the sli@@ me m@@ old as a way of engaging a community to map their area .
Here , the sli@@ me m@@ old is being used directly as a biological tool , but met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically as a symbol for ways of talking about social cohesion , communication and cooperation .
Other public engagement activities , I run lots of sli@@ me m@@ old workshops , a creative way of engaging with the organis@@ m .
So people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do , and they design their own pet@@ ri dish experiment , an environment for the sli@@ me m@@ old to navig@@ ate so they can test its properties .
Every@@ body takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the Sli@@ me M@@ ould Colle@@ c@@ tive .
There 's something about ca@@ ves -- a sha@@ dow@@ y opening in a li@@ me@@ stone cli@@ ff that draws you in .
As you pass through the portal between light and dark , you enter a sub@@ terranean world -- a place of perpet@@ ual glo@@ om , of ear@@ thy sm@@ ells , of h@@ ush@@ ed silence .
Long ago in Europe , ancient people also entered these underground worlds .
As witness to their passage , they left behind mysteri@@ ous en@@ grav@@ ings and paintings , like this panel of humans , tri@@ ang@@ les and zig@@ z@@ ags from O@@ jo Gu@@ are@@ ña in Spain .
You now walk the same path as these early artists .
And in this sur@@ real , o@@ ther@@ worl@@ dly place , it 's almost possible to imagine that you hear the mu@@ ff@@ led foot@@ fall of skin boo@@ ts on soft earth , or that you see the fli@@ ck@@ ering of a tor@@ ch around the next bend .
When I 'm in a ca@@ ve , I often find myself wonder@@ ing what dro@@ ve these people to go so deep to bra@@ ve dangerous and narrow pas@@ sa@@ ge@@ ways to leave their mark ?
In this video cli@@ p , that was shot half a kilom@@ eter , or about a third of a mile , underground , in the ca@@ ve of Cu@@ don in Spain , we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously un@@ explo@@ red section of the ca@@ ve .
As we cra@@ w@@ led forward , militar@@ y-@@ style , with the ceiling getting ever lower , we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photograph@@ er , D@@ yl@@ an , could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DS@@ L@@ R camera .
So while he fil@@ med me , I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ shoo@@ t camera that we kept for that type of occasion .
Hal@@ f a kilom@@ eter underground .
Seri@@ ously .
What was som@@ ebo@@ dy doing down there with a tor@@ ch or a stone lam@@ p ?
I mean -- me , it makes sense , right ?
But you know , this is the kind of question that I 'm trying to answer with my research .
I study some of the oldest art in the world .
It was created by these early artists in Europe , between 10,000 and 40@@ ,000 years ago .
And the thing is that I 'm not just studying it because it 's beautiful , though some of it certainly is .
But what I 'm interested in is the development of the modern mind , of the evolution of creativity , of imagination , of abstra@@ ct thought , about what it means to be human .
While all species communicate in one way or another , only we humans have really taken it to another level .
Our desire and ability to share and collabor@@ ate has been a huge part of our success story .
Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange made possible , in large part , by our ability to communicate -- in particular , using graphic or written forms of communication .
The thing is , though , that we 've been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it 's easy to forget that certain abilities haven 't already existed .
It 's one of the things I find most fascinating about studying our deep history .
Those people didn 't have the shoul@@ ders of any gi@@ ants to stand on .
They were the original shoul@@ ders .
And while a surprising number of important in@@ ven@@ tions come out of that distant time , what I want to talk to you about today is the in@@ vention of graphic communication .
There are three main types of communication , spoken , gest@@ ural -- so things like sign language -- and graphic communication .
Spo@@ ken and gest@@ ural are by their very nature eph@@ emer@@ al .
The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist , as an Iranian woman artist , as an Iranian woman artist living in ex@@ ile .
Well , it has its pl@@ uses and min@@ uses .
On the dark side , politics doesn 't seem to escape people like me .
Every Iranian artist , in one form or another , is political .
Politi@@ cs have defined our lives .
If you 're living in Iran , you 're facing c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , har@@ ass@@ ment , arrest , torture -- at times , execution .
If you 're living outside like me , you 're faced with life in ex@@ ile -- the pain of the long@@ ing and the separation from your loved ones and your family .
Therefore , we don 't find the moral , emotional , psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility .
Od@@ dly enough , an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice , the speaker of my people , even if I have , indeed , no access to my own country .
Also , people like myself , we 're fighting two batt@@ les on different grounds .
We 're being critical of the West , the perception of the West about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
We are there to take pride and insist on respect .
And at the same time , we 're fighting another battle .
That is our regime , our government -- our atro@@ cious government , [ that ] has done every crime in order to stay in power .
Our artists are at risk .
We are in a position of danger .
We pose a threat to the order of the government .
But ir@@ on@@ ically , this situation has em@@ powered all of us , because we are considered , as artists , central to the cultural , political , social dis@@ course in Iran .
We are there to in@@ sp@@ ire , to provo@@ ke , to mobili@@ ze , to bring hope to our people .
We are the re@@ por@@ ters of our people , and are communic@@ ators to the outside world .
Art is our weapon .
Culture is a form of resistance .
I en@@ vy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression .
For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics .
From the fact that they are only serving one audience , mainly the Western culture .
But also , I worry about the West , because often in this country , in this Western world that we have , culture risks being a form of entertainment .
Our people depend on our artists , and culture is beyond communication .
My journey as an artist started from a very , very personal place .
I did not start to make social com@@ mentary about my country .
The Naz@@ is inv@@ aded the Netherlands .
Their gri@@ m plans were evident .
They meant to rule by means of repression .
Diplom@@ acy had failed to stop the Germans .
Only bru@@ te force remained .
It was our last resort .
My father was there to provide it .
As the son of a far@@ mer who knew how to hun@@ t , my father was an excellent mark@@ s@@ man .
When he aimed , he never missed .
At this decisive moment in Dutch history my father was positioned on the bank of the river Wa@@ al near the city of Ni@@ j@@ me@@ gen .
He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occup@@ y a free country , his country , our country .
He fi@@ red . Nothing happened .
He fi@@ red again .
No German soldi@@ er fell to the ground .
My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite ri@@ verb@@ ank .
Hitler 's troops mar@@ ched on , and there was nothing my father could do about it .
Until the day my father died , he was frustr@@ ated about missing these shots .
He could have done something .
But with an old gun , not even the best mark@@ s@@ man in the armed forces could have hit the mark .
So this story stayed with me .
Then in high school , I was gri@@ pped by the stories of the Al@@ lied soldiers -- soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and ris@@ ked their lives to liber@@ ate a country and a people that they didn 't know .
They liber@@ ated my birth town .
It was then that I decided I would take up the gun -- out of respect and grati@@ tude for those men and women who came to liber@@ ate us .
From the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil .
And that is why I took up the gun -- not to shoo@@ t , not to kill , not to destroy , but to stop those who would do evil , to protect the vulnerable , to defend democratic values , to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place .
Ladies and gentlemen , I do not stand here today to tell you about the gl@@ ory of weapons .
I do not like g@@ uns .
And once you have been under fire yourself , it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some mach@@ o instrument to b@@ rag about .
I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability .
The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world .
Now this may sound contradic@@ tory to you .
But not only have I seen with my own eyes during my deplo@@ y@@ ments in Lebanon , Sar@@ aje@@ vo and as the Netherlands ' Chief of Defence , this is also supported by cold , hard statistics .
Viol@@ ence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years .
Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news , wars between developed countries are no longer comm@@ on@@ place .
The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle A@@ ges .
And occurr@@ ences of civil war and repression have declined since the end of the Cold War .
Statisti@@ cs show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era .
Why ?
Why has violence decreased ?
Has the human mind changed ?
Well , we were talking about the human mind this morning .
Di@@ d we simply lose our be@@ ast@@ ly impul@@ ses for re@@ ven@@ ge , for violent rit@@ u@@ als , for pure rage ?
Or is there something else ?
What is a cor@@ al and where does it come from ?
Cor@@ als are born in a number of different ways , but most often by mass spa@@ wn@@ ing : all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year , rele@@ asing all the eggs they 've made that year into the water column , pack@@ aged into bund@@ les with sper@@ m cells .
And those bund@@ les go to the surface of the ocean and break apart .
And hopefully -- hopefully -- at the surface of the ocean , they meet the eggs and sper@@ m from other cor@@ als .
And that is why you need lots of cor@@ als on a cor@@ al re@@ ef -- so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface .
When they 're fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zed , they do what any other animal eg@@ g does : divi@@ des in half again and again and again .
Taking these photos under the micro@@ scope every year is one of my favorite and most ma@@ gical moments of the year .
At the end of all this cell division , they turn into a swimming lar@@ va -- a little tiny blo@@ b of fat the size of a po@@ ppy seed , but with all of the sens@@ ory systems that we have .
They can sense color and light , tex@@ tures , chemicals , p@@ H .
They can even feel pressure waves ; they can hear sound .
And they use those tal@@ ents to search the bottom of the re@@ ef for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives .
So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life They attach in the place they find most suitable , they build a sk@@ el@@ et@@ on under@@ ne@@ ath themselves , they build a mouth and tent@@ ac@@ les , and then they begin the difficult work of building the world 's cor@@ al re@@ efs .
One cor@@ al poly@@ p will divide itself again and again and again , leaving a li@@ me@@ stone sk@@ el@@ et@@ on under@@ ne@@ ath itself and growing up toward the sun .
Given hundreds of years and many species , what you get is a massive li@@ me@@ stone structure that can be seen from space in many cases , covered by a thin skin of these hard@@ working animals .
Now , there are only a few hundred species of cor@@ als on the planet , maybe 1,000 .
But these systems house millions and millions of other species , and that diversity is what stabili@@ zes the systems , and it 's where we 're finding our new medicines .
It 's how we find new sources of food .
I 'm lu@@ cky enough to work on the island of Cur@@ a@@ ç@@ ao , where we still have re@@ efs that look like this .
But , indeed , much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this .
Scienti@@ sts have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world 's cor@@ al re@@ efs , and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes .
But in my research , I 'm not interested in looking back@@ ward .
My colleagues and I in Cur@@ a@@ ç@@ ao are interested in looking forward at what might be .
And we have the t@@ ini@@ est reason to be optimistic .
Because even in some of these re@@ efs that we probably could have written off long ago , we sometimes see baby cor@@ als arrive and survive anyway .
And we 're starting to think that baby cor@@ als may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn 't .
They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more re@@ adily to this human planet .
So in the research I do with my colleagues in Cur@@ a@@ ç@@ ao , we try to figure out what a baby cor@@ al needs in that critical early stage , what it 's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process .
I 'm going to show you three examples of the work we 've done to try to answer those questions .
A few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made cor@@ al choice surveys -- different colors and different tex@@ tures , and we simply asked the cor@@ al where they preferred to settle .
And we found that cor@@ als , even without the bi@@ ology involved , still prefer white and p@@ ink , the colors of a healthy re@@ ef .
And they prefer cre@@ vi@@ ces and gro@@ o@@ ves and holes , where they will be safe from being tra@@ m@@ pled or e@@ aten by a pre@@ dat@@ or .
So we can use this knowledge , we can go back and say we need to restore those factors -- that p@@ ink , that white , those cre@@ vi@@ ces , those hard surfaces -- in our conservation projects .
We can also use that knowledge if we 're going to put something under@@ water , like a sea wall or a p@@ ier .
We can choose to use the materials and colors and tex@@ tures that might bi@@ as the system back toward those cor@@ als .
Now in addition to the surfaces , we also study the chemical and micro@@ bi@@ al signals that attract cor@@ als to re@@ efs .
Starting about six years ago , I began cul@@ turing bacter@@ ia from surfaces where cor@@ als had settled .
And I tried those one by one by one , looking for the bacter@@ ia that would convince cor@@ als to settle and attach .
And we now have many bacter@@ ial stra@@ ins in our free@@ zer that will reli@@ ably cause cor@@ als to go through that settlement and atta@@ chment process .
So as we speak , my colleagues in Cur@@ a@@ ç@@ ao are testing those bacter@@ ia to see if they 'll help us raise more cor@@ al sett@@ lers in the la@@ b , and to see if those cor@@ al sett@@ lers will survive better when we put them back under@@ water .
This is a river .
This is a stream .
This is a river .
This is happening all over the country .
There are tens of thousands of miles of de@@ water@@ ed stre@@ ams in the United States .
On this map , the colo@@ red areas represent water conflicts .
Simil@@ ar problems are emerging in the east as well .
The reasons vary state to state , but mostly in the details .
There are 4@@ ,000 miles of de@@ water@@ ed stre@@ ams in Mon@@ tana alone .
They would ordin@@ arily support fish and other wild@@ life .
They 're the v@@ eins of the eco@@ system , and they 're often empty v@@ eins .
I want to tell you the story of just one of these stre@@ ams because it 's an arch@@ et@@ ype for the larger story .
This is Pri@@ ck@@ ly Pe@@ ar Cre@@ ek .
It runs through a populated area from East Hel@@ ena to Lake Hel@@ ena .
It supports wild fish including cut@@ thro@@ at , bro@@ wn and rain@@ bo@@ w tro@@ ut .
N@@ early every year for more than a hundred years , it 's looked like this in the summer .
How did we get here ?
Well , it started back in the late 18@@ 00@@ s when people started sett@@ ling in places like Mon@@ tana .
In short , there was a lot of water and there weren 't very many people .
But as more people showed up wanting water , the fol@@ ks who were there first got a little concerned , and in 18@@ 65 , Mon@@ tana passed its first water law .
It basically said , everybody near the stream can share in the stream .
Od@@ dly , a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream , and the fol@@ ks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers .
There were preced@@ ent-@@ setting suits in 18@@ 70 and 18@@ 72 , both involving Pri@@ ck@@ ly Pe@@ ar Cre@@ ek .
And in 19@@ 21 , the Mon@@ tana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Pri@@ ck@@ ly Pe@@ ar that the fol@@ ks who were there first had the first , or " senior water rights . "
These senior water rights are key .
The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this .
Some of these cre@@ eks have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream .
Similarly , there 's been explo@@ sive growth in India , for example , where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 2@@ 70 percent a year .
This is powered by low-@@ cost V@@ SA@@ T technology , aggres@@ sively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market .
China 's D@@ ali@@ an Comm@@ o@@ dity Exchange , three years ago , 2004 , over@@ took the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world .
Now , in Ethiopia , we 're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Comm@@ o@@ dity Exchange .
We 're not trying to cut and pa@@ ste the Chicago model or the India model , but creating a system uniqu@@ ely tailored to Ethiopia 's needs and realities , Ethiopia 's small farmers .
So , the EC@@ X is an Ethiop@@ ian exchange for Ethiopia .
We 're creating a system that serves all market actors , that creates integrity , trust , efficiency , transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described .
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia , we 've done something rather unique , which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective , or what we call the EC@@ X E@@ dge .
The EC@@ X E@@ dge pretty much creates the entire eco@@ system in which the market will develop itself .
And this is because one of the things we 've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the pi@@ ec@@ em@@ e@@ al approach does not work .
You 've got one donor trying to develop market information , another trying to work on or spons@@ or grades and standards , another ICT , and yet another on wa@@ reh@@ ous@@ ing , or ware@@ house recei@@ pts .
In our approach in Ethiopia , we 've decided to put together the entire eco@@ system , or environment , in which trade takes place .
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system , which will initially start as an open out@@ c@@ ry , because we don 't think the country 's ready for full electronic trading .
But at the same time , we 'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done , which is itself to operate something like an Internet caf@@ e in the rural areas .
So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call the remote access terminal centers -- and actually , without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things , simply see the trading that 's happening on the Addi@@ s Ab@@ aba trading floor .
At the same time , what 's very fundamental to this market is that -- and again , an innovation that we 've designed for our exchange -- is that the exchange will operate wa@@ reh@@ ouses around the country , in which grade certification and ware@@ house recei@@ p@@ ting will be done .
And in turn , we 'll operate an in-house clearing system , to assure that payment is done appropriately , in the right amount and at the right time , so that basically , we create trust and integrity in the system .
Obviously , we work with exchange actors , and as we 're developing the exchange market itself , we 're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework , the over@@ ar@@ ching legal framework for making this market work .
So , in fact , our proc@@ lam@@ ation is going to parliament next month .
What 's really important is that the EC@@ X will operate a market information system to dissemin@@ ate prices in real time to farmers around the country , using V@@ SA@@ T technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers .
What this does is trans@@ forms , fundamentally , the farmers ' relationship to the market .
Whereas before the far@@ mer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market , eight to 10 kilometers away on average , and sell whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market .
And they start to think national , and even global .
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions , but also plan@@ ting decisions , on the basis of information coming from the fut@@ ures price market .
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium .
So all of this will transform farmers .
It will also transform the way traders do business .
It will stop them from doing simple , back@@ -to-@@ back , limited arbit@@ rage to really thinking strategi@@ cally about how to move grain across long distances from [ surplus regions ] to [ deficit areas ] .
Can Ethiopia do this ?
It seems very ambitious .
But it will create new opportunities .
We believe that this initiative requires great political will , and we 'll have to align the financial sector , as well as the ICT sector , and really even the underlying legal framework .
We believe that the win@@ ds of change are here , and that we can do it .
EC@@ X is the market for Ethiopia 's new mill@@ enni@@ um , which starts in about eight months .
The last parliament of our century opened with our president announ@@ cing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today .
We believe that the sta@@ kes are high , but that the returns will be even greater .
EC@@ X , moreover , can become a trading platform for a pan@@ -@@ African market in agricultural commodities .
Ethiopia 's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value .
And we feel that over the next five years , if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent , just 40 percent , of the domestic market , and add just 25 percent value to that market , the value of the market doub@@ les .
Ethiopia 's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa 's grain production , and , in fact , Ethiopia is the second largest ma@@ ize producer in Africa .
So the potential is there .
The will is there .
The commitment is there .
So we feel that we have a winning value pro@@ position to transform farmers ' choices , to grow our agriculture , and to change Africa .
So , we are in the business of finding our happ@@ iness .
When I was a k@@ id , the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war .
That 's why we had a bar@@ rel like this down in our bas@@ ement , filled with cans of food and water .
When the nuclear attack came , we were supposed to go down@@ stairs , hun@@ ker down , and eat out of that bar@@ rel .
Today the greatest risk of global catastro@@ phe doesn 't look like this .
Instead , it looks like this .
If anything k@@ ills over 10 million people in the next few decades , it 's most likely to be a highly infec@@ tious virus rather than a war .
Not missi@@ les , but micro@@ bes .
Now , part of the reason for this is that we 've invested a huge amount in nuclear deter@@ ren@@ ts .
But we 've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epide@@ mic .
We 're not ready for the next epide@@ mic .
Let 's look at Eb@@ ola .
I 'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper , lots of tough challenges .
I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track poli@@ o eradication .
And as you look at what went on , the problem wasn 't that there was a system that didn 't work well enough , the problem was that we didn 't have a system at all .
In fact , there 's some pretty obvious key missing pieces .
We didn 't have a group of epide@@ mi@@ ologists ready to go , who would have gone , seen what the disease was , seen how far it had spread .
The case reports came in on paper .
It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely in@@ accurate .
We didn 't have a medical team ready to go .
We didn 't have a way of preparing people .
Now , Mé@@ dec@@ ins S@@ ans Fron@@ ti@@ ères did a great job or@@ chest@@ rating volunte@@ ers .
But even so , we were far s@@ lower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries .
And a large epide@@ mic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers .
There was no one there to look at treatment approaches .
No one to look at the diagnosti@@ cs .
No one to figure out what tools should be used .
As an example , we could have taken the blood of survi@@ vor@@ s , processed it , and put that plas@@ ma back in people to protect them .
But that was never tried .
So there was a lot that was missing .
And these things are really a global failure .
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries .
But where are they situated ?
I will s@@ wap the bub@@ bles to a map .
Look , the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the HI@@ V-@@ infected .
HIV exists all over the world .
Look , you have bub@@ bles all over the world here .
Brazil has many HI@@ V-@@ infected .
Arab countries not so much , but Iran is quite high .
They have her@@ o@@ in addi@@ ction and also prostitution in Iran .
India has many because they are many .
Sou@@ theast Asia , and so on .
But , there is one part of Africa -- and the difficult thing is , at the same time , not to make a uniform statement about Africa , not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this , on one hand .
On the other hand , try to say that this is not the case , because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now .
UN@@ AIDS have done good data available , finally , about the spread of HIV .
It could be conc@@ urr@@ ency .
It could be some virus types .
It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency .
After all , if you are completely healthy and you have hetero@@ sexual sex , the risk of infection in one inter@@ course is one in 1,000 .
Don 't j@@ ump to conclusions now on how to be@@ have tonight and so on .
But -- and if you are in an un@@ favor@@ able situation , more sex@@ ually transmitted diseases , it can be one in 100 .
But what we think is that it could be conc@@ urr@@ ency .
And what is conc@@ urr@@ ency ?
In Sweden , we have no conc@@ urr@@ ency .
We have serial mon@@ og@@ am@@ y .
V@@ od@@ ka , New Year 's E@@ ve -- new partner for the spring .
V@@ od@@ ka , Mid@@ summer 's E@@ ve -- new partner for the fall .
V@@ od@@ ka -- and it goes on like this , you know ?
And you collect a big number of ex@@ es .
And we have a terrible ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia epide@@ mic -- terrible ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia epide@@ mic which sti@@ cks around for many years .
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore , having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others .
Pro@@ b@@ ably , it 's a combination of this .
And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this .
You can get this chart , free .
We have up@@ loaded UN@@ AIDS data on the G@@ ap@@ min@@ der site .
And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart , we will not only have the money , but we will also use the brain .
Then , even a one percentage point reduction in the ext@@ inc@@ tion risk could be equivalent to this astronom@@ ical number -- 10 to the power of 32 .
So if you take into account future generations as much as our own , every other moral imperative of phil@@ an@@ throp@@ ic cost just becomes ir@@ relevant .
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce exist@@ ential risk because even the t@@ ini@@ est decrease in exist@@ ential risk would just overwhel@@ m any other benefit you could hope to achieve .
And even if you just look at the current people , and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went ext@@ inc@@ t , it should still have a high priority .
Now , let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem , because it 's more sub@@ tle and perhaps difficult to gras@@ p .
Th@@ ink about some time in your life -- some people might never have experienced it -- but some people , there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic .
It might have been at the moment of some great , creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage .
Or when you understood something you had never done before .
Or perhaps in the ec@@ st@@ asy of romantic love .
Or an aes@@ thetic experience -- a sun@@ set or a great piece of art .
Every once in a while we have these moments , and we realize just how good life can be when it 's at its best .
And you wonder , why can 't it be like that all the time ?
You just want to cling onto this .
And then , of course , it dri@@ fts back into ordinary life and the memory fa@@ des .
And it 's really difficult to recall , in a normal frame of mind , just how good life can be at its best .
Or how bad it can be at its worst .
The third big problem is that life isn 't usually as wonderful as it could be .
I think that 's a big , big problem .
It 's easy to say what we don 't want .
Here are a number of things that we don 't want -- illness , invol@@ un@@ tary death , unnecessary suffering , cru@@ el@@ ty , stun@@ ted growth , memory loss , ignor@@ ance , absence of creativity .
Sup@@ pose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these .
We were very successful .
We got rid of all of these things .
We might end up with something like this , which is -- I mean , it 's a h@@ eck of a lot better than that .
But is this really the best we can dream of ?
Is this the best we can do ?
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspir@@ ing to work towards ?
And if we think about this , I think it 's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things , not just by eliminating neg@@ atives , but adding positives .
On my wish list , at least , would be : much longer , health@@ ier lives , greater subjec@@ tive well-being , enhanced co@@ gni@@ tive capacities , more knowledge and understanding , unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits , better relationships , an un@@ bo@@ unded potential for spiritual , moral and intellectual development .
If we want to achieve this , what , in the world , would have to change ?
And this is the answer -- we would have to change .
Not just the world around us , but we , ourselves .
Not just the way we think about the world , but the way we are -- our very bi@@ ology .
Human nature would have to change .
Now , when we think about changing human nature , the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies -- growth hor@@ m@@ one therapy , cosme@@ tic surgery , stimul@@ ants like R@@ ital@@ in , Ad@@ der@@ all , anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ants , an@@ abo@@ lic ster@@ o@@ ids , artificial hearts .
It 's a pretty pa@@ thetic list .
They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition , but for most people , they don 't really transform what it is to be human .
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this inst@@ inc@@ t that , well , sure , there needs to be anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ants for the really de@@ pressed people .
But there 's a kind of qu@@ eas@@ iness that these are un@@ natural in some way .
It 's worth rec@@ alling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enh@@ ancement technologies that we use .
We have skin enh@@ anc@@ ements , clothing .
As far as I can see , all of you are users of this enh@@ ancement technology in this room , so that 's a great thing .
M@@ ood modi@@ fi@@ ers have been used from time im@@ mem@@ orial -- c@@ aff@@ eine , alcohol , ni@@ cot@@ ine , imm@@ une system enh@@ ancement , vision enh@@ ancement , an@@ es@@ theti@@ cs -- we take that very much for granted , but just think about how great progress that is -- like , having an operation before an@@ es@@ theti@@ cs was not fun .
Contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cosme@@ tics and brain re@@ programming techniques -- that sounds omin@@ ous , but the distinction between what is a technology -- a g@@ ad@@ get would be the arch@@ et@@ ype -- and other ways of changing and re@@ writing human nature is quite sub@@ tle .
So if you think about what it means to learn ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic or to learn to read , you 're actually , literally re@@ writing your own brain .
You 're changing the micro@@ structure of your brain as you go along .
So in a broad sense , we don 't need to think about technology as only little g@@ ad@@ gets , like these things here , but even institutions and techniques , psychological methods and so forth .
For@@ ms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature .
Looking ahead , there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later .
Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war .
These are not normally the most che@@ er@@ ful of topics , nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about .
Yet , not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago , but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inf@@ lic@@ t .
Three things stand out : leadership , diplomacy and institutional design .
What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter , how they matter , and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways , that is , how all of us can contribute to developing and hon@@ ing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last .
But let 's start at the beginning .
Civil wars have made news head@@ lines for many decades now , and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat .
For nearly two decades now , the news has been bad and the images have been ha@@ un@@ ting .
In Georgia , after years of stal@@ em@@ ate , we saw a full-@@ scale res@@ ur@@ gence of violence in August , 2008 .
This quickly escal@@ ated into a five-@@ day war between Russia and Georgia , leaving Georgia ever more divided .
In Kenya , con@@ tested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-@@ ethnic violence and the killing and dis@@ placement of thousands of people .
In Sri Lanka , a dec@@ ad@@ es-@@ long civil war between the Tam@@ il minority and the Sin@@ hal@@ a majority led to a bloo@@ dy cli@@ max in 2009 , after perhaps as many as 100@@ ,000 people had been killed since 1983 .
In K@@ yr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , just over the last few weeks , unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic K@@ yr@@ gy@@ z and ethnic Uz@@ be@@ ks .
H@@ und@@ reds have been killed , and more than 100@@ ,000 displaced , including many ethnic Uz@@ be@@ ks who fl@@ ed to neighbor@@ ing Uz@@ bekistan .
In the Middle East , conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unab@@ ated , and it becomes ever more difficult to see how , just how a possible , sustainable solution can be achieved .
Darfur may have sli@@ pped from the news head@@ lines , but the killing and dis@@ placement there continues as well , and the she@@ er human mis@@ ery that it creates is very hard to fa@@ tho@@ m .
And in Iraq , finally , violence is on the rise again , and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections .
But hang on , this talk is to be about the good news .
So are these now the images of the past ?
Well , not@@ with@@ standing the glo@@ om@@ y pictures from the Middle East , Darfur , Iraq , elsewhere , there is a lon@@ ger-@@ term trend that does represent some good news .
Over the past two decades , since the end of the Cold War , there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars .
Since the high in the early 1990s , with about 50 such civil wars ongoing , we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today .
The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two .
But this trend is less un@@ ambiguous .
The highest level of deaths on the batt@@ le@@ field was recorded between 1998 and 2001 , with about 80@@ ,000 soldiers , polic@@ emen and re@@ bels killed every year .
The lowest number of comb@@ at@@ ant cas@@ u@@ alties occurred in 2003 , with just 20@@ ,000 killed .
Despite the up and down since then , the overall trend -- and this is the important bit -- clearly points down@@ ward for the past two decades .
The news about civilian cas@@ u@@ alties is also less bad than it used to be .
From over 12@@ ,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998 , a decade later , this figure stands at 4@@ ,000 .
This is a decrease by two-@@ thirds .
This decline would be even more obvious if we fac@@ to@@ red in the genocide in Rwand@@ a in 1994 .
But then 800@@ ,000 civilians were slau@@ gh@@ tered in a matter of just a few months .
This certainly is an accompl@@ ishment that must never be sur@@ passed .
What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story .
They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war , from hunger or disease , for example .
There is , for example , a project that 's underway to sequence a thousand individuals -- their gen@@ om@@ es -- from different parts of the world .
They 've sequ@@ enced 18@@ 5 Afri@@ cans from two populations in Africa .
[ They 've ] sequ@@ enced approximately equally [ as ] many people in Europe and in China .
And we can begin to say how much vari@@ ance do we find , how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequ@@ ences .
And it 's a lot : 38 million variable positions .
But we can then ask : Are there any absolute differences between Afri@@ cans and non-@@ Afri@@ cans ?
Perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed .
And with absolute difference -- and I mean a difference where people inside Africa at a certain position , where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter , and everybody outside Africa has another letter .
And the answer to that , among those millions of differences , is that there is not a single such position .
This may be surprising .
May@@ be a single individual is mis@@ classified or so .
So we can relax the criterion a bit and say : How many positions do we find where 95 percent of people in Africa have one vari@@ ant , 95 percent another vari@@ ant , and the number of that is 12 .
So this is very surprising .
It means that when we look at people and see a person from Africa and a person from Europe or Asia , we cannot , for a single position in the gen@@ ome with 100 percent accuracy , pre@@ dict what the person would carry .
And only for 12 positions can we hope to be 95 percent right .
This may be surprising , because we can , of course , look at these people and quite easily say where they or their anc@@ est@@ ors came from .
So what this means now is that those tra@@ its we then look at and so re@@ adily see -- fac@@ ial features , skin color , hair structure -- are not determined by single genes with big effects , but are determined by many different genetic vari@@ ants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world .
There is another thing with those tra@@ its that we so easily observe in each other that I think is worth@@ while to consider , and that is that , in a very liter@@ al sense , they 're really on the surface of our bodies .
They are what we just said -- fac@@ ial features , hair structure , skin color .
There are also a number of features that vary between contin@@ ents like that that have to do with how we met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze food that we in@@ gest , or that have to do with how our imm@@ une systems deal with micro@@ bes that try to inv@@ ade our bodies .
But so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly inter@@ act with our environment , in a direct confron@@ tation , if you like .
It 's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shi@@ fted frequ@@ encies of genes that are involved in them .
But if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don 't directly inter@@ act with the environment -- our kid@@ neys , our li@@ vers , our hearts -- by just looking at these organs , where in the world they would come from .
So there 's another interesting thing that comes from this re@@ alization that humans have a recent common origin in Africa , and that is that when those humans emerged around 100@@ ,000 years ago or so , they were not alone on the planet .
There were other forms of humans around , most fam@@ ously perhaps , Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als -- these robust forms of humans , compared to the left here with a modern human sk@@ el@@ et@@ on on the right -- that existed in Western Asia and Europe since several hundreds of thousands of years .
So an interesting question is , what happened when we met ?
What happened to the Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als ?
And to begin to answer such questions , my research group -- since over 25 years now -- works on methods to extrac@@ t DNA from remains of Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als and ext@@ inc@@ t animals that are tens of thousands of years old .
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extrac@@ t the DNA , how you convert it to a form you can sequence .
You have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with DNA from yourself .
And this then , in conjunction with these methods that allow very many DNA mole@@ cul@@ es to be sequ@@ enced very rapidly , allowed us last year to present the first version of the Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al gen@@ ome , so that any one of you can now look on the Internet , on the Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al gen@@ ome , or at least on the 55 percent of it that we 've been able to re@@ construct so far .
And you can begin to compare it to the gen@@ om@@ es of people who live today .
And one question that you may then want to ask is , what happened when we met ?
Di@@ d we mix or not ?
And the way to ask that question is to look at the Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al that comes from Southern Europe and compare it to gen@@ om@@ es of people who live today .
So we then look to do this with pa@@ irs of individuals , starting with two Afri@@ cans , looking at the two African gen@@ om@@ es , finding places where they differ from each other , and in each case ask : What is a Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al like ?
Does it match one African or the other African ?
And it was a re@@ vel@@ ation .
We travel@@ ed through five seas , two oc@@ e@@ ans , nine ports , and I learned a lot about shipping .
And one of the first things that surprised me when I got on board K@@ end@@ al was , where are all the people ?
I have friends in the Nav@@ y who tell me they sa@@ il with 1,000 sa@@ il@@ ors at a time , but on K@@ end@@ al there were only 21 crew .
Now that 's because shipping is very efficient .
Con@@ tain@@ eri@@ zation has made it very efficient .
Shi@@ ps have automation now .
They can operate with small cre@@ ws .
But it also means that , in the words of a port chap@@ la@@ in I once met , the average seaf@@ ar@@ er you 're going to find on a container ship is either ti@@ red or exhau@@ sted , because the pace of modern shipping is quite pun@@ ishing for what the shipping calls its human element , a strange phrase which they don 't seem to realize sounds a little bit in@@ human .
So most seaf@@ ar@@ ers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time .
They don 't have time to relax .
They 're at sea for months at a time , and even when they 're on board , they don 't have access to what a five-@@ year-old would take for granted , the Internet .
And another thing that surprised me when I got on board K@@ end@@ al was who I was sitting next to -- Not the qu@@ een ; I can 't imagine why they put me under@@ ne@@ ath her portra@@ it -- But around that dining table in the officer 's s@@ alo@@ on , I was sitting next to a Bur@@ m@@ ese guy , I was opposite a Romanian , a Molda@@ vian , an Indian .
On the next table was a Chinese guy , and in the crew room , it was entirely Fili@@ p@@ inos .
So that was a normal working ship .
Now how is that possible ?
Because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last 60 years , when most of the general public stopped notic@@ ing it , was something called an open reg@@ istry , or a flag of convenience .
Shi@@ ps can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag reg@@ istry .
You can get a flag from the land@@ locked nation of Boli@@ via , or Mongo@@ lia , or North Korea , though that 's not very popular .
So we have these very multinational , global , mobile cre@@ ws on ships .
And that was a surprise to me .
And when we got to pir@@ ate waters , down the Bab@@ -@@ el-@@ Man@@ de@@ b stra@@ it and into the Indian Ocean , the ship changed .
And that was also sho@@ cking , because suddenly , I realized , as the cap@@ tain said to me , that I had been cra@@ zy to choose to go through pir@@ ate waters on a container ship .
We were no longer allowed on deck .
There were double pir@@ ate wat@@ ches .
And at that time , there were those 5@@ 44 seaf@@ ar@@ ers being held ho@@ stage , and some of them were held ho@@ stage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience .
Not all of them , but some of them were , because for the minority of un@@ sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous ship owners , it can be easy to hide behind the anony@@ m@@ ity offered by some fla@@ gs of convenience .
What else does our sea blin@@ dness m@@ ask ?
Well , if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cru@@ ise ship , and look up to the fun@@ nel , you 'll see very black smoke .
And that 's because shipping has very tight margins , and they want cheap fuel , so they use something called bun@@ ker fuel , which was described to me by someone in the tan@@ ker industry as the d@@ reg@@ s of the refin@@ ery , or just one step up from asp@@ halt .
I study ants in the desert , in the tropical forest and in my kitchen , and in the hills around Si@@ lic@@ on Valley where I live .
I 've recently realized that ants are using inter@@ actions differently in different environments , and that got me thinking that we could learn from this about other systems , like bra@@ ins and data networks that we engine@@ er , and even cancer .
So what all these systems have in common is that there 's no central control .
An ant col@@ ony consists of st@@ eri@@ le female workers -- those are the ants you see walking around - and then one or more re@@ productive fem@@ ales who just lay the eggs .
They don 't give any instructions .
Even though they 're called que@@ ens , they don 't tell any@@ body what to do .
So in an ant col@@ ony , there 's no one in charge , and all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple inter@@ actions .
An@@ ts inter@@ act using sm@@ ell .
They sm@@ ell with their anten@@ na@@ e , and they inter@@ act with their anten@@ na@@ e , so when one ant tou@@ ches another with its anten@@ na@@ e , it can tell , for example , if the other ant and what task that other ant has been doing .
So here you see a lot of ants moving around and inter@@ acting in a la@@ b arena that 's connected by tu@@ bes to two other ar@@ en@@ as .
So when one ant meets another , it doesn 't matter which ant it meets , and they 're actually not trans@@ mitting any kind of complicated signal or message .
All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants .
And all of these inter@@ actions , taken together , produce a network .
So this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena , and it 's this constantly shi@@ fting network that produces the behavior of the col@@ ony , like whether all the ants are hi@@ ding inside the n@@ est , or how many are going out to for@@ age .
A brain actually works in the same way , but what 's great about ants is that you can see the whole network as it happens .
There are more than 12@@ ,000 species of ants , in every conc@@ ei@@ vable environment , and they 're using inter@@ actions differently to meet different environmental challenges .
So one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs , just what it takes to run the system .
And another environmental challenge is resources , finding them and collecting them .
In the desert , operating costs are high because water is scar@@ ce , and the se@@ ed-@@ eating ants that I study in the desert have to spend water to get water .
So an ant outside for@@ aging , searching for seeds in the hot sun , just loses water into the air .
But the col@@ ony gets its water by met@@ abo@@ liz@@ ing the f@@ ats out of the seeds that they eat .
So in this environment , inter@@ actions are used to activate for@@ aging .
An out@@ going for@@ ager doesn 't go out unless it gets enough inter@@ actions with returning for@@ agers , and what you see are the returning for@@ agers going into the tunnel , into the n@@ est , and meeting out@@ going for@@ agers on their way out .
This makes sense for the ant col@@ ony , because the more food there is out there , the more quickly the for@@ agers find it , the faster they come back , and the more for@@ agers they send out .
The system works to stay stopped , unless something positive happens .
So inter@@ actions function to activate for@@ agers .
And we 've been studying the evolution of this system .
First of all , there 's vari@@ ation .
It turns out that colon@@ ies are different .
On dry days , some colon@@ ies for@@ age less , so colon@@ ies are different in how they manage this tra@@ de-@@ off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds .
And we 're trying to understand why some colon@@ ies for@@ age less than others by thinking about ants as ne@@ ur@@ ons , using models from neuro@@ science .
I 'm a veter@@ an of the star@@ ship Enterprise .
I so@@ ared through the gal@@ ax@@ y driving a huge star@@ ship with a crew made up of people from all over this world , many different races , many different cultures , many different her@@ it@@ ages , all working together , and our mission was to explore strange new worlds , to seek out new life and new civi@@ liz@@ ations , to bol@@ dly go where no one has gone before .
Well - - I am the grand@@ son of immigrants from Japan who went to America , bol@@ dly going to a strange new world , seeking new opportunities .
My mother was born in Sac@@ ra@@ mento , California .
My father was a San Franc@@ is@@ can .
They met and married in Los Angeles , and I was born there .
I was four years old when P@@ ear@@ l Har@@ bor was bom@@ bed on December 7 , 19@@ 41 by Japan , and overnight , the world was pl@@ ung@@ ed into a world war .
America suddenly was swe@@ pt up by h@@ yst@@ eria .
Jap@@ an@@ es@@ e-@@ Americans , American citizens of Japanese anc@@ est@@ ry , were looked on with suspici@@ on and fear and with ou@@ tri@@ ght hat@@ red simply because we happened to look like the people that bom@@ bed P@@ ear@@ l Har@@ bor .
And the h@@ yst@@ eria grew and grew until in February 19@@ 42 , the president of the United States , Fran@@ kl@@ in Del@@ ano Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t , ordered all Jap@@ an@@ es@@ e-@@ Americans on the West Coast of America to be summ@@ arily rounded up with no charges , with no trial , with no due process .
Due process , this is a core pillar of our justice system .
That all disappeared .
We were to be rounded up and im@@ pris@@ oned in 10 bar@@ bed@@ -@@ wire prison camps in some of the most des@@ ol@@ ate places in America : the bl@@ ister@@ ing hot desert of Ari@@ zona , the sul@@ try sw@@ amps of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as , the wa@@ stel@@ ands of W@@ y@@ oming , I@@ dah@@ o , U@@ ta@@ h , Col@@ or@@ ado , and two of the most des@@ ol@@ ate places in California .
On April 20th , I celebrated my fifth birthday , and just a few weeks after my birthday , my parents got my younger brother , my baby s@@ ister and me up very early one morning , and they dres@@ sed us hur@@ ri@@ edly .
My brother and I were in the living room looking out the front window , and we saw two soldiers mar@@ ching up our dri@@ ve@@ way .
They carried bay@@ on@@ ets on their ri@@ f@@ les .
They st@@ om@@ ped up the front por@@ ch and b@@ ang@@ ed on the door .
My father answered it , and the soldiers ordered us out of our home .
My father gave my brother and me small lug@@ g@@ ages to carry , and we wal@@ ked out and stood on the dri@@ ve@@ way waiting for our mother to come out , and when my mother finally came out , she had our baby s@@ ister in one arm , a huge du@@ ff@@ el bag in the other , and te@@ ars were streaming down both her che@@ eks .
I will never be able to forget that scene .
It is bur@@ ned into my memory .
We were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other Jap@@ an@@ es@@ e-@@ American families .
There were gu@@ ards station@@ ed at both ends of each car , as if we were criminals .
We were taken two thirds of the way across the country , ro@@ cking on that train for four days and three nights , to the sw@@ amps of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
I still remember the bar@@ bed wire f@@ ence that confined me .
I remember the t@@ all s@@ entry tower with the machine g@@ uns pointed at us .
I remember the sear@@ ch@@ light that followed me when I made the night runs from my bar@@ ra@@ ck to the lat@@ r@@ ine .
But to five-@@ year-old me , I thought it was kind of nice that they 'd lit the way for me to pe@@ e .
I was a child , too young to understand the circumstances of my being there .
Children are amaz@@ ingly adap@@ table .
What would be gro@@ tes@@ qu@@ ely ab@@ normal became my norm@@ ality in the prison@@ er of war camps .
And you even find a church .
And on the 30@@ th floor , there is a gym where all the wei@@ ghts and bar@@ b@@ ells are made out of the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver pul@@ le@@ ys from the elev@@ ators which were never installed .
From the outside , behind this al@@ wa@@ y@@ s-@@ changing fac@@ ade , you see how the fixed concrete be@@ ams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic , intuitive way that respon@@ ds directly to their needs .
Let 's go now to Africa , to Nigeria , to a community called Mak@@ ok@@ o , a sl@@ um where 15@@ 0,000 people live just meters above the Lag@@ os Lag@@ o@@ on .
While it may appear to be a completely cha@@ o@@ tic place , when you see it from above , there seems to be a whole grid of water@@ ways and can@@ als connecting each and every home .
From the main do@@ ck , people board long wooden can@@ oes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expan@@ sive area .
When out on the water , it 's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living .
Even the can@@ oes become variety stores where ladies p@@ add@@ le from house to house , selling anything from to@@ oth@@ pa@@ ste to fresh fruits .
Behin@@ d every window and door frame , you 'll see a small child pe@@ ering back at you , and while Mak@@ ok@@ o seems to be packed with people , what 's more sho@@ cking is actually the amount of children po@@ uring out of every building .
The population growth in Nigeria , and especially in these areas like Mak@@ ok@@ o , are painful remin@@ ders of how out of control things really are .
In Mak@@ ok@@ o , very few systems and infrastructures exist .
Electri@@ city is rig@@ ged and fresh@@ est water comes from self-@@ built well@@ s throughout the area .
This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water , so fishing and bo@@ at-@@ making are common professions .
You 'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area , like bar@@ ber@@ shops , CD and DVD stores , movie theat@@ ers , tail@@ ors , everything is there .
There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspir@@ ation to live in a real house or to be associated with a far@@ away place , like that hotel in Sweden .
On this particular evening , I came across this live band dres@@ sed to the T in their coordinating out@@ fits .
They were flo@@ ating through the can@@ als in a large can@@ o@@ e with a fit@@ te@@ d-@@ out gener@@ ator for all of the community to enjoy .
By night@@ fall , the area becomes almost pit@@ ch black , save for a small ligh@@ t@@ bul@@ b or a fire .
What originally brought me to Mak@@ ok@@ o was this project from a friend of mine , Kun@@ l@@ é A@@ de@@ y@@ em@@ i , who recently finished building this three-@@ story flo@@ ating school for the kids in Mak@@ ok@@ o .
With this entire village existing on the water , public space is very limited , so now that the school is finished , the ground floor is a play@@ ground for the kids , but when classes are out , the platform is just like a town square , where the fishermen mend their nets and flo@@ ating sh@@ op@@ keep@@ ers do@@ ck their boats .
Another place I 'd like to share with you is the Z@@ ab@@ bal@@ een in C@@ airo .
They 're des@@ cen@@ dants of farmers who began mig@@ rating from the upper Egypt in the ' 4@@ 0s , and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over C@@ airo .
For years , the Z@@ ab@@ bal@@ een would live in ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities , but in the early 1980s , they settled on the Mo@@ kat@@ ta@@ m rocks just at the eastern edge of the city .
Today , they live in this area , approximately 50@@ ,000 to 70@@ ,000 people , who live in this community of self-@@ built multi-@@ story houses where up to three generations live in one structure .
While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid , each family speci@@ alizing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for gar@@ ba@@ ge-@@ related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space .
I find it incredible to see how these pil@@ es and pil@@ es of gar@@ b@@ age are inv@@ isi@@ ble to the people who live there , like this very distinguished man who is posing while all this gar@@ b@@ age is sort of streaming out behind him , or like these two young men who are sitting and ch@@ at@@ ting amongst these tons of gar@@ b@@ age .
While to most of us , living amongst these pil@@ es and pil@@ es of gar@@ b@@ age may seem totally un@@ inhab@@ itable , to those in the Z@@ ab@@ bal@@ een , this is just a different type of normal .
In all these places I 've talked about today , what I do find fascinating is that there 's really no such thing as normal , and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation .
Throughout the day , it 's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets , just like this engagement party .
In this tradition , the bri@@ de-@@ to-@@ be displays all of their belong@@ ings , which they soon bring to their new husband .
Unfortunately , global carbon emissions from de@@ fore@@ station now equ@@ als the global transportation sector .
That 's all ships , air@@ plan@@ es , trains and automob@@ iles combined .
So it 's understandable that policy negoti@@ ators have been working hard to reduce de@@ fore@@ station , but they 're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science .
If you don 't know where the carbon is exactly , in detail , how can you know what you 're losing ?
Basi@@ cally , we need a high-@@ tech accounting system .
With our system , we 're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail .
The red shows , obviously , clo@@ se@@ d-@@ can@@ op@@ y tropical forest , and then you see the cook@@ ie cutting , or the cutting of the forest in yel@@ lows and gre@@ ens .
It 's like cutting a ca@@ ke except this ca@@ ke is about wh@@ ale deep .
And yet , we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time .
And what 's amazing is , even though we fle@@ w very high above this forest , later on in analysis , we can go in and actually experience the tre@@ et@@ ro@@ ps , lea@@ f by lea@@ f , branch by branch , just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves .
We 've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geo@@ grap@@ hi@@ es in high resolution in far@@ away places like the Amaz@@ on Bas@@ in and no@@ t-@@ so-@@ far@@ away places like the United States and Central America .
What I 'm going to do is I 'm going to take you on a high-@@ resolution , first-@@ time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Pan@@ ama .
The colors are going to be going from red to blue .
Red is extremely high carbon stocks , your largest cathedral forests you can imagine , and blue are very low carbon stocks .
And let me tell you , Peru alone is an amazing place , totally unknown in terms of its carbon geograph@@ y until today .
We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red , and the Amaz@@ on River and floo@@ d@@ plain cutting right through it .
We can go to an area of utter dev@@ ast@@ ation caused by de@@ fore@@ station in blue , and the virus of de@@ fore@@ station spreading out in orange .
We can also fly to the southern An@@ des to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geograph@@ y ends as we go up into the mountain system .
And we can go to the biggest sw@@ amp in the western Amaz@@ on .
It 's a water@@ y dre@@ am@@ world ak@@ in to J@@ im Cam@@ eron 's " Av@@ atar . "
We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries , Pan@@ ama , and see also a huge range of carbon vari@@ ation , from high in red to low in blue .
Unfortunately , most of the carbon is lost in the low@@ lands , but what you see that 's left , in terms of high carbon stocks in gre@@ ens and reds , is the stuff that 's up in the mountains .
One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen .
You 're seeing the buffer zone around the Pan@@ ama Canal .
That 's in the reds and yel@@ lows .
The can@@ al authorities are using force to protect their water@@ shed and global commerce .
This kind of carbon ma@@ pping has transformed conservation and resource policy development .
It 's really adv@@ ancing our ability to save forests and to cur@@ b climate change .
My second question : How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amaz@@ on rain@@ forest ?
Let me tell you , I spend a lot of time in these places , and we 're seeing the climate changing already .
Temperat@@ ures are increasing , and what 's really happening is we 're getting a lot of d@@ rou@@ ghts , recurr@@ ing d@@ rou@@ ghts .
The 2010 me@@ ga@@ -@@ d@@ rought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe .
The Amaz@@ on was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the Amaz@@ on river itself dri@@ ed up partially , as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide .
What we found is that in very remote areas , these d@@ rou@@ ghts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests .
For example , these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the 2010 d@@ rought .
This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil , totally un@@ explo@@ red , almost totally unknown scienti@@ fically .
So what we think , as Earth scientists , is species are going to have to mig@@ rate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the An@@ des and up into the mountains in order to minim@@ ize their exposure to climate change .
One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amaz@@ on as we speak .
Look at this 100@@ -@@ squ@@ are@@ -@@ kilom@@ eter gas@@ h in the forest created by gold min@@ ers .
To do that , we need to charter a research boat .
This is the James C@@ ook , an oc@@ e@@ an-@@ class research vessel mo@@ ored up in Teneri@@ fe .
Loo@@ ks beautiful , right ?
Great , if you 're not a great mar@@ iner .
Sometimes it looks a little more like this .
This is us trying to make sure that we don 't lose precious samples .
Everyone 's s@@ curr@@ ying around , and I get terri@@ bly se@@ asi@@ ck , so it 's not always a lot of fun , but overall it is .
So we 've got to become a really good ma@@ pper to do this .
You don 't see that kind of spectacular cor@@ al abund@@ ance everywhere .
It is global and it is deep , but we need to really find the right places .
We just saw a global map , and over@@ laid was our cru@@ ise passage from last year .
This was a seven@@ -@@ week cru@@ ise , and this is us , having made our own maps of about 75@@ ,000 square kilometers of the seaf@@ lo@@ or in seven weeks , but that 's only a tiny fra@@ ction of the seaf@@ lo@@ or .
We 're travel@@ ing from west to east , over part of the ocean that would look feat@@ u@@ reless on a big@@ -@@ scale map , but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest .
So with the maps that we make on board , we get about 100@@ -@@ meter resolution , enough to pick out areas to deplo@@ y our equipment , but not enough to see very much .
To do that , we need to fly remo@@ tel@@ y-@@ operated vehicles about five meters off the seaf@@ lo@@ or .
And if we do that , we can get maps that are one-@@ meter resolution down thousands of meters .
Here is a remo@@ tel@@ y-@@ operated vehicle , You can see an array of big lights on the top .
There are high-@@ definition cameras , manipul@@ ator arms , and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples .
Here we are on our first dive of this particular cru@@ ise , pl@@ ung@@ ing down into the ocean .
We go pretty fast to make sure the remo@@ tely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships .
And we go down , and these are the kinds of things you see .
These are deep sea spon@@ ges , meter scale .
This is a swimming h@@ olo@@ th@@ ur@@ ian -- it 's a small sea s@@ lug , basically .
This is s@@ lowed down .
Most of the foo@@ tage I 'm showing you is spee@@ ded up , because all of this takes a lot of time .
This is a beautiful h@@ olo@@ th@@ ur@@ ian as well .
And this animal you 're going to see coming up was a big surprise .
I 've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised .
This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trig@@ ger-@@ happy , and suddenly this giant sea mon@@ ster started rolling past .
It 's called a py@@ ro@@ some or colonial t@@ unic@@ ate , if you like .
This wasn 't what we were looking for .
We were looking for cor@@ als , deep sea cor@@ als .
You 're going to see a picture of one in a moment .
It 's small , about five c@@ enti@@ meters high .
It 's made of cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate , so you can see its tent@@ ac@@ les there , moving in the ocean curr@@ ents .
An organis@@ m like this probably lives for about a hundred years .
And as it gro@@ ws , it takes in chemicals from the ocean .
And the chemicals , or the amount of chemicals , depends on the temperature ; it depends on the p@@ H , it depends on the nutri@@ ents .
And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the sk@@ el@@ et@@ on , we can then go back , collect fossil speci@@ mens , and re@@ construct what the ocean used to look like in the past .
And here you can see us collecting that cor@@ al with a vacuum system , and we put it into a sam@@ pling container .
We can do this very carefully , I should add .
Some of these organisms live even longer .
This is a black cor@@ al called Lei@@ opath@@ es , an image taken by my colleague , Br@@ end@@ an Ro@@ ark , about 500 meters below Ha@@ wa@@ ii .
Now the traditional method of surve@@ ying carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars to look up in the tre@@ et@@ ops where you might find an or@@ ang@@ ut@@ an or its n@@ est .
Now as you can imagine , that is a very time-@@ consu@@ ming , lab@@ or-@@ intensive , and costly process , so we were hoping that d@@ ron@@ es could significantly reduce the cost of surve@@ ying for or@@ ang@@ ut@@ an populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Sou@@ theast Asia .
So we were very exc@@ ited when we captured our first pair of or@@ ang@@ ut@@ an ne@@ sts on camera .
And this is it ; this is the first ever picture of or@@ ang@@ ut@@ an ne@@ sts taken with a dr@@ one .
Since then we have taken pictures of doz@@ ens of these ne@@ sts from around various parts of Sou@@ theast Asia , and we 're now working with computer scientists to develop algorith@@ ms that can automatically count the number of ne@@ sts from the thousands of photos we 've collected so far .
But ne@@ sts are not the only objects these d@@ ron@@ es can detect .
This is a wild or@@ ang@@ ut@@ an happ@@ ily feeding on top of a pal@@ m tree , seem@@ ingly ob@@ li@@ vious to our dr@@ one that was flying over@@ head , not once but several times .
We 've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buff@@ alo@@ s in Gab@@ on , el@@ ep@@ han@@ ts , and even tur@@ tle ne@@ sts .
But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves , we also take pictures of the habit@@ ats these animals live in , because we want to keep track of the health of these habit@@ ats .
Sometimes , we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape .
This is an oil pal@@ m plant@@ ation in Sum@@ at@@ ra .
Now oil pal@@ m is a major driver of de@@ fore@@ station in that part of the world , so we wanted to use this new dr@@ one technology to keep track of the spread of these plant@@ ations in Sou@@ theast Asia .
But d@@ ron@@ es could also be used to keep track of illegal log@@ ging activities .
This is a recently log@@ ged forest , again in Sum@@ at@@ ra .
You could even still see the processed wooden plan@@ ks left on the ground .
But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stit@@ ch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape , and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change , to let us know where and when plant@@ ations might be expanding , where forests might be contracting , or where fires might be breaking out .
A@@ erial images could also be processed to produce three-@@ dimensional computer models of forests .
Now these models are not just vis@@ ually appe@@ aling , but they are also geomet@@ ri@@ cally accurate , which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees , calcul@@ ate surface area , the volume of vegetation , and so on , all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests .
Recently , we 've also begun experi@@ menting with thermal ima@@ ging cameras .
Now these cameras can detect he@@ at-@@ emit@@ ting objects from the ground , and therefore they are very useful for detec@@ ting po@@ ach@@ ers or their camp@@ fires at night .
So I 've told you quite a lot about what conservation d@@ ron@@ es are , how you might operate one of these d@@ ron@@ es , and what a dr@@ one could do for you .
I will now tell you where conservation d@@ ron@@ es are being used around the world .
We built our first proto@@ type d@@ ron@@ es in Switzerland .
We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights .
Since then , we 've been building d@@ ron@@ es for our collabor@@ ators from around the world , and these include fellow bi@@ ologists and partners from major conservation organizations .
Perhaps the best and most rewar@@ ding part about working with these collabor@@ ators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our d@@ ron@@ es .
Building d@@ ron@@ es for us is a constant work in progress .
We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range , their ru@@ g@@ ge@@ dness , and the amount of pay@@ load they can carry .
We also work with collabor@@ ators to discover new ways of using these d@@ ron@@ es .
I had , to me , a fascinating job writing about world affairs , but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think -- or really , to understand if I was truly happy .
And so , I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the back@@ streets of Kyoto , Japan , which was the place that had long ex@@ er@@ ted a strong , really mysteri@@ ous gra@@ vit@@ ational pull on me .
Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it ; I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it .
But it 's also , as you all know , a beautiful city en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by hills , filled with more than 2@@ ,000 tem@@ ples and shr@@ ines , where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more .
And quite soon after I moved there , I ended up where I still am with my wife , formerly our kids , in a two-@@ room apartment in the middle of no@@ where where we have no bicycle , no car , no TV I can understand , and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist , so clearly this is not ideal for job adv@@ ancement or for cultural exc@@ itement
or for social di@@ version .
But I realized that it gives me what I prize most , which is days and hours .
I have never once had to use a cell phone there .
I almost never have to look at the time , and every morning when I wake up , really the day stret@@ ches in front of me like an open me@@ ad@@ ow .
And when life thro@@ ws up one of its n@@ asty sur@@ prises , as it will , more than once , when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression , or a car suddenly ve@@ ers in front of mine on the free@@ way , I know , in my b@@ ones , that it 's the time I 've spent going no@@ where that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I 've spent racing around to B@@ hut@@ an or E@@ aster Island .
I 'll always be a travel@@ er -- my live@@ lihood depends on it -- but one of the beau@@ ties of travel is that it allows you to bring still@@ ness into the motion and the commo@@ tion of the world .
I once got on a plane in Frankfurt , Germany , and a young German woman came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly convers@@ ation for about 30 minutes , and then she just turned around and sat still for 12 hours .
She didn 't once turn on her video monitor , she never pul@@ led out a book , she didn 't even go to sleep , she just sat still , and something of her clarity and calm really im@@ par@@ ted itself to me .
I 've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives .
Some people go to black@@ -@@ hole resorts where they 'll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their lap@@ top to the front desk on arrival .
Some people I know , just before they go to sleep , instead of sc@@ rolling through their messages or checking out YouTube , just turn out the lights and listen to some music , and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refresh@@ ed .
I was once fortunate enough to drive into the high , dark mountains behind Los Angeles , where the great po@@ et and singer and international hear@@ t@@ thro@@ b Leon@@ ard Co@@ hen was living and working for many years as a full-@@ time mon@@ k in the Mount Bal@@ dy Z@@ en Center .
And I wasn 't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of 77 , to which he gave the deliberately un@@ sex@@ y title of " Old Ide@@ as , " went to number one in the char@@ ts in 17 nations in the world , hit the top five in nine others .
Some@@ thing in us , I think , is cr@@ ying out for the sense of intim@@ acy and depth that we get from people like that .
who take the time and trouble to sit still .
And I think many of us have the sens@@ ation , I certainly do , that we 're standing about two in@@ ches away from a huge screen , and it 's noisy and it 's crow@@ ded and it 's changing with every second , and that screen is our lives .
And it 's only by step@@ ping back , and then further back , and holding still , that we can begin to see what the can@@ v@@ as means and to catch the larger picture .
And a few people do that for us by going no@@ where .
So , in an age of acceler@@ ation , nothing can be more ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating than going slow .
And in an age of dis@@ tra@@ ction , nothing is so luxurious as paying attention .
And in an age of constant movement , nothing is so urgent as sitting still .
So you can go on your next vacation to Paris or Ha@@ wa@@ ii , or New Or@@ le@@ ans ; I bet you 'll have a wonderful time .
But , if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope , in love with the world , I think you might want to try considering going no@@ where .
I 'm a gar@@ b@@ age man .
And you might find it interesting that I became a gar@@ b@@ age man , because I absolutely h@@ ate waste .
I hope , within the next 10 minutes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .
And I 'd like to start at the very beginning .
Th@@ ink back when you were just a k@@ id .
How did look at the stuff in your life ?
Perhaps it was like these to@@ dd@@ ler rules : It 's my stuff if I saw it first .
The entire p@@ ile is my stuff if I 'm building something .
The more stuff that 's mine , the better .
And of course , it 's your stuff if it 's broken .
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry , it 's become pretty clear to me that we don 't necessarily leave these to@@ dd@@ ler rules behind as we develop into adults .
And let me tell you why I have that perspective .
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million po@@ unds of people 's dis@@ car@@ ded stuff .
Now a million po@@ unds a day sounds like a lot of stuff , but it 's a tiny drop of the dur@@ able goods that are dis@@ posed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent .
In fact , the United Nations estimates that there 's about 85 billion po@@ unds a year of electronics waste that gets dis@@ car@@ ded around the world each and every year -- and that 's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream .
And if you throw in other dur@@ able goods like automob@@ iles and so forth , that number well more than doub@@ les .
And of course , the more developed the country , the bigger these mountains .
Now when you see these mountains , most people think of gar@@ b@@ age .
We see abo@@ ve-@@ ground mines .
And the reason we see mines is because there 's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
And it 's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extrac@@ t these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste stre@@ ams .
Because as we 've heard all week at T@@ ED , the world 's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff .
And of course , they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted .
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?
It 's mostly many types of plas@@ tics and many types of metals .
And the metals , we typically get from ore that we mine in ever wi@@ dening mines and ever deepening mines around the world .
And the plas@@ tics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and dri@@ ll ever deeper well@@ s to extrac@@ t .
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we 're already starting to see today .
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-@@ of-@@ life stuff and starting to recy@@ cle our end-@@ of-@@ life stuff , particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recy@@ cl@@ ed in a responsible manner .
Most of what 's extrac@@ ted from our end-@@ of-@@ life stuff , if it makes it to a recy@@ c@@ ler , are the metals .
To put that in perspective -- and I 'm using steel as a pro@@ xy here for metals , because it 's the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recy@@ c@@ ler , probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and re@@ used for another purpose .
Plas@@ tics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
In fact , it 's more like five percent .
Most of it 's inc@@ iner@@ ated or land@@ filled .
Now most people think that 's because plas@@ tics are a thro@@ w-@@ away material , have very little value .
But actually , plas@@ tics are several times more valuable than steel .
And there 's more plas@@ tics produced and consu@@ med around the world on a volume basis every year than steel .
So why is such a pl@@ enti@@ ful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ?
So now I 'm going to show you a number of projects that we 've built , from one-@@ dimensional , two-@@ dimensional , three-@@ dimensional and even four-@@ dimensional systems .
So in one-@@ dimensional systems -- this is a project called the self-@@ fol@@ ding pro@@ t@@ eins .
And the idea is that you take the three-@@ dimensional structure of a protein -- in this case it 's the cra@@ m@@ bin protein -- you take the back@@ bone -- so no cross-@@ linking , no environmental inter@@ actions -- and you break that down into a series of components .
And then we em@@ bed el@@ astic .
And when I throw this up into the air and catch it , it has the full three-@@ dimensional structure of the protein , all of the in@@ tri@@ c@@ acies .
And this gives us a tangible model of the three-@@ dimensional protein and how it fol@@ ds and all of the in@@ tri@@ c@@ acies of the geomet@@ ry .
So we can study this as a physical , intuitive model .
And we 're also transl@@ ating that into two-@@ dimensional systems -- so flat sheets that can self-@@ fold into three-@@ dimensional structures .
In three dimensions , we did a project last year at T@@ ED@@ Global with Auto@@ desk and Ar@@ thur Ol@@ son where we looked at autonomous parts -- so individual parts not pre-@@ connected that can come together on their own .
And we built 500 of these glass be@@ ak@@ ers .
They had different mole@@ cular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched .
And we gave them away to all the T@@ ED@@ sters .
And so these became intuitive models to understand how mole@@ cular self-@@ assembly works at the human scale .
This is the poli@@ o virus .
You sha@@ ke it hard and it breaks apart .
And then you sha@@ ke it rand@@ om@@ ly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own .
And this is demonstrating that through random energy , we can build non-@@ random shapes .
We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale .
Last year at T@@ ED Long Beach , we built an installation that builds installations .
The idea was , could we self-@@ assem@@ ble fur@@ nit@@ ure-@@ scale objects ?
So we built a large rot@@ ating chamber , and people would come up and sp@@ in the chamber faster or s@@ lower , adding energy to the system and getting an intuitive understanding of how self-@@ assembly works and how we could use this as a macro@@ scale construction or manufacturing technique for products .
So remember , I said 4@@ D .
So today for the first time , we 're un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling a new project , which is a collaboration with Str@@ at@@ as@@ ys , and it 's called 4@@ D printing .
The idea behind 4@@ D printing is that you take multi-@@ material 3D printing -- so you can deposit multiple materials -- and you add a new capability , which is transformation , that right off the bed , the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own .
And this is like ro@@ bo@@ tics without wi@@ res or mo@@ tors .
So you completely print this part , and it can transform into something else .
We also worked with Auto@@ desk on a software they 're developing called Project Cy@@ borg .
Our calculation shows that qu@@ ant@@ um tun@@ n@@ eling of the Hig@@ gs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years , and this is a very long time .
It 's even longer than the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government .
Even so , we will be long gone by then .
In about five billion years , our sun will become a red giant , as large as the Earth 's or@@ bit , and our Earth will be kap@@ ut , and in a thousand billion years , if dark energy keeps on fu@@ eling space expansion at the present rate , you will not even be able to see as far as your to@@ es , because everything around you exp@@ ands at a rate faster than the speed of light .
So it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the Hig@@ gs field collapse .
But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Hig@@ gs field is because I want to address the question , why is the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son mass so special ?
Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition ?
The@@ ore@@ tical physi@@ c@@ ists always ask " why " questions .
More than how a phenomenon works , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works .
We think that this these " why " questions can give us clu@@ es about the fundamental principles of nature .
And indeed , a possible answer to my question opens up new univers@@ es , literally .
It has been specul@@ ated that our universe is only a bub@@ ble in a so@@ ap@@ y multi@@ verse made out of a multitude of bub@@ bles , and each bub@@ ble is a different universe with different fundamental con@@ stan@@ ts and different physical laws .
And in this context , you can only talk about the prob@@ ability of finding a certain value of the Hig@@ gs mass .
Then the key to the myst@@ ery could lie in the statistical properties of the multi@@ verse .
It would be something like what happens with sand dun@@ es on a beach .
In principle , you could imagine to find sand dun@@ es of any slo@@ pe angle in a beach , and yet , the slo@@ pe ang@@ les of sand dun@@ es are typically around 30 , 35 degrees .
And the reason is simple : because wind builds up the sand , grav@@ ity makes it fall .
As a result , the vast majority of sand dun@@ es have slo@@ pe ang@@ les around the critical value , near to collapse .
And something similar could happen for the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son mass in the multi@@ verse .
In the majority of bub@@ ble univers@@ es , the Hig@@ gs mass could be around the critical value , near to a cosm@@ ic collapse of the Hig@@ gs field , because of two competing effects , just as in the case of sand .
My story does not have an end , because we still don 't know the end of the story .
This is science in progress , and to solve the myst@@ ery , we need more data , and hopefully , the L@@ H@@ C will soon add new clu@@ es to this story .
Just one number , the Hig@@ gs bo@@ son mass , and yet , out of this number we learn so much .
I started from a hypo@@ thesis , that the known parti@@ cles are all there is in the universe , even beyond the domain explo@@ red so far .
From this , we discovered that the Hig@@ gs field that per@@ me@@ ates spac@@ e-@@ time may be standing on a kni@@ fe edge , ready for cosm@@ ic collapse , and we discovered that this may be a hin@@ t that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach , the multi@@ verse .
But I don 't know if my hypo@@ thesis is right .
That 's how physi@@ cs works : A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley .
But wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever it turns out to be , there is one thing I 'm sure of : The journey will be full of sur@@ prises .
It is actually a reality today that you can download products from the Web -- product data , I should say , from the Web -- perhaps t@@ weak it and person@@ alize it to your own preference or your own taste , and have that information sent to a desktop machine that will fabri@@ c@@ ate it for you on the spot .
We can actually build for you , very rapidly , a physical object .
And the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called addi@@ tive manufacturing , or 3D printing .
This is a 3D printer .
They have been around for almost 30 years now , which is quite amazing to think of , but they 're only just starting to filter into the public arena .
And typically , you would take data , like the data of a pen here , which would be a geomet@@ ric representation of that product in 3D , and we would pass that data with material into a machine .
And a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built .
And we can take out the physical product , and ready to use , or to , perhaps , assem@@ ble into something else .
But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years , why don 't we know about them ?
Because typically they 've been too in@@ efficient , in@@ accessible , they 've not been fast enough , they 've been quite expensive .
But today , it is becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful .
Many barriers are breaking down .
That means that you gu@@ ys will soon be able to access one of these machines , if not this minute .
And it will change and dis@@ rupt the landscape of manufacturing , and most certainly our lives , our businesses and the lives of our children .
So how does it work ?
It typically reads CAD data , which is a product design data created on professional product design programs .
And here you can see an engine@@ er -- it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer -- create a product in 3D .
And this data gets sent to a machine that s@@ lic@@ es the data into two-@@ dimensional represent@@ ations of that product all the way through -- almost like s@@ lic@@ ing it like sal@@ ami .
And that data , layer by layer , gets passed through the machine , starting at the base of the product and depos@@ iting material , layer upon layer , inf@@ using the new layer of materials to the old layer in an addi@@ tive process .
And this material that 's depos@@ ited either starts as a liquid form or a material pow@@ der form .
And the bon@@ ding process can happen by either mel@@ ting and depos@@ iting or depos@@ iting then mel@@ ting .
In this case , we can see a laser sin@@ tering machine developed by EOS .
It 's actually using a laser to f@@ use the new layer of material to the old layer .
And over time -- quite rapidly actually , in a number of hours -- we can build a physical product , ready to take out of the machine and use .
And this is quite an extraordinary idea , but it is reality today .
So all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way .
They were all 3D printed .
And you can see , they 're ranging from shoes , r@@ ings that were made out of stainless ste@@ al , phone covers out of plastic , all the way through to sp@@ in@@ al im@@ plants , for example , that were created out of medi@@ cal@@ -@@ grade tit@@ anium , and engine parts .
But what you 'll notice about all of these products is they 're very , very in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate .
The design is quite extraordinary .
Because we 're taking this data in 3D form , s@@ lic@@ ing it up before it gets past the machine , we can actually create structures that are more in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate than any other manufacturing technology -- or , in fact , are impossible to build in any other way .
And you can create parts with moving components , h@@ ing@@ es , parts within parts .
So in some cases , we can abolish totally the need for manual labor .
It sounds great .
It is great .
We can have 3D pr@@ inters today that build structures like these .
This is almost three meters high .
And this was built by depos@@ iting artificial sand@@ stone layer upon layer in layers of about five milli@@ meters to 10 mm in thi@@ ckness -- slowly growing this structure .
This was created by an architectural firm called Sh@@ ir@@ o .
And you can actually walk into it .
And on the other end of the spectrum , this is a micro@@ structure .
It 's created depos@@ iting layers of about four m@@ ic@@ ron@@ s .
So really the resolution is quite incredible .
The detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
So who 's using it ?
Typ@@ ically , because we can create products very rapidly , it 's been used by product designers , or anyone who wanted to proto@@ type a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design .
And actually what 's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bes@@ po@@ ke products en m@@ asse .
