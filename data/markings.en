Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother, Mamar, in our four-family home in Brooklyn, New York.
Her apartment was an oasis.
It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee, which was really warm milk with just a touch of caffeine.
She loved life.
And although she worked in a factory, she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe.
And I remember poring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music.
And then, when I was eight and she was 60, something changed.
She no longer worked or traveled.
She no longer danced.
There were no more coffee times.
My mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn't make a diagnosis.
And my father, who worked at night, would spend every afternoon with her, just to make sure she ate.
Her care became all-consuming for our family.
And by the time a diagnosis was made, she was in a deep spiral.
Now many of you will recognize her symptoms.
My grandmother had depression.
A deep, life-altering depression, from which she never recovered.
And back then, so little was known about depression.
But even today, 50 years later, there's still so much more to learn.
Today, we know that women are 70 percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men.
And even with this high prevalence, women are misdiagnosed between 30 and 50 percent of the time.
Now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain and anxiety compared with men.
And these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression.
And it isn't only depression in which these sex differences occur, but they occur across so many diseases.
So it's my grandmother's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest.
And today, I lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women.
Today, we know that every cell has a sex.
Now, that's a term coined by the Institute of Medicine.
And what it means is that men and women are different down to the cellular and molecular levels.
It means that we're different across all of our organs.
From our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints.
Now, it was only 20 years ago that we hardly had any data on women's health beyond our reproductive functions.
But then in 1993, the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law.
And what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities be included in clinical trials that were funded by the National Institutes of Health.
And in many ways, the law has worked.
Women are now routinely included in clinical studies, and we've learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease.
But remarkably, what we have learned about these differences is often overlooked.
So, we have to ask ourselves the question: Why leave women's health to chance?
And we're leaving it to chance in two ways.
The first is that there is so much more to learn and we're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences.
And the second is that we aren't taking what we have learned, and routinely applying it in clinical care.
We are just not doing enough.
So, I'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have impacted the health of women, and where we need to do more.
Let's start with heart disease.
When I was nine years old, my mom asked me what I would want my house to look like, and I drew this fairy mushroom.
And then she actually built it.
I don't think I realized this was so unusual at the time, and maybe I still haven't, because I'm still designing houses.
This is a six-story bespoke home on the island of Bali.
It's built almost entirely from bamboo.
The living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor.
You enter the house by a bridge.
It can get hot in the tropics, so we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes.
But some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out.
This room we left open.
We made an air-conditioned, tented bed.
And one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room.
Boxing off an area with tall walls just didn't feel right, so instead, we made this giant woven pod.
Now, we do have all the necessary luxuries, like bathrooms.
This one is a basket in the corner of the living room, and I've got tell you, some people actually hesitate to use it.
We have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation.
So there are lots of things that we're still working on, but one thing I have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right.
It's actually a wild grass.
It grows on otherwise unproductive land -- deep ravines, mountainsides.
It lives off of rainwater, spring water, sunlight, and of the 1,450 species of bamboo that grow across the world, we use just seven of them.
That's my dad.
He's the one who got me building with bamboo, and he is standing in a clump of Dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago.
Each year, it sends up a new generation of shoots.
That shoot, we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week, so we're talking about sustainable timber in three years.
Now, we harvest from hundreds of family-owned clumps.
Betung, as we call it, it's really long, up to 18 meters of usable length.
Try getting that truck down the mountain.
And it's strong: it has the tensile strength of steel, the compressive strength of concrete.
Slam four tons straight down on a pole, and it can take it.
Because it's hollow, it's lightweight, light enough to be lifted by just a few men, or, apparently, one woman.
And when my father built Green School in Bali, he chose bamboo for all of the buildings on campus, because he saw it as a promise.
But there are still some unique traits.
I mean, why would you want to do all these things for real?
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.
And you see here a picture of a tissue section.
And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.
Which means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats, in principle, can be implanted and disappear.
And what you see there in that tissue section, in fact, is you see that reflector tape.
So, much like you're seen at night by a car, then the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue, you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk.
And you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue.
And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing, but reintegration in the environment is important.
So you have a clock, you have protein, and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt --  unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday.
It's edible, so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food.
It doesn't taste good, so I'm going to need some help with that.
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.
Silk, during its self-assembly process, acts like a cocoon for biological matter.
And so if you change the recipe, and you add things when you pour -- so you add things to your liquid silk solution -- where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines, the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants.
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive.
So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together -- and deliver drugs at the same, while your bone is healing, for example.
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge.
So we've made a silk card with penicillin in it.
And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C, so 140 degrees Fahrenheit, for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin.
And so that could be ---  that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels.  And of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it].
And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.
And so what you see there is the difference.
In the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade, and in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.
And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it.
So it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before.
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you've seen.
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread.
We're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do, whether you want to replace a vein or a bone, or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics, perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt, maybe carry your drugs in your pocket, deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert, the answer may be in a thread of silk.
Now, I mentioned that there are two definitions of rewilding that interest me.
The other one is the rewilding of human life.
And I don't see this as an alternative to civilization.
I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology, as we're doing now, but at the same time, if we choose, have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure when we want to because there would be wonderful, rewilded habitats.
And the opportunities for this are developing more rapidly than you might think possible.
There's one estimate which suggests that in the United States, two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated, particularly from the eastern half of the country.
There's another one which suggests that 30 million hectares of land in Europe, an area the size of Poland, will be vacated by farmers between 2000 and 2030.
Now, faced with opportunities like that, does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx, bears, beavers, bison, boar, moose, and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across Europe?
Perhaps we should also start thinking about the return of some of our lost megafauna.
What megafauna, you say?
Well, every continent had one, apart from Antarctica.
When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated, the river gravels there were found to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus, rhinos, elephants, hyenas, lions.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, there were lions in Trafalgar Square long before Nelson's Column was built.
All these species lived here in the last interglacial period, when temperatures were pretty similar to our own.
It's not climate, largely, which has got rid of the world's megafaunas.
It's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so.
And even so, you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems.
Why is it that so many deciduous trees are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken?
Why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark?
Why do understory trees, which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind and have to carry less weight than the big canopy trees, why are they so much tougher and harder to break than the canopy trees are?
Elephants.
They are elephant-adapted.
In Europe, for example, they evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant, elephas antiquus, which was a great beast.
It was related to the Asian elephant, but it was a temperate animal, a temperate forest creature.
It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant.
But why is it that some of our common shrubs have spines which seem to be over-engineered to resist browsing by deer?
Perhaps because they evolved to resist browsing by rhinoceros.
Isn't it an amazing thought that every time you wander into a park or down an avenue or through a leafy street, you can see the shadows of these great beasts?
Paleoecology, the study of past ecosystems, crucial to an understanding of our own, feels like a portal through which you may pass into an enchanted kingdom.
And if we really are looking at areas of land of the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available, why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna, or at least species closely related to those which have become extinct everywhere?
Why shouldn't all of us have a Serengeti on our doorsteps?
And perhaps this is the most important thing that rewilding offers us, the most important thing that's missing from our lives: hope.
In motivating people to love and defend the natural world, an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair.
The story rewilding tells us is that ecological change need not always proceed in one direction.
It offers us the hope that our silent spring could be replaced by a raucous summer.
I am a Hazara, and the homeland of my people is Afghanistan.
Like hundreds of thousands of other Hazara kids, I was born in exile.
The ongoing persecution and operation against the Hazaras forced my parents to leave Afghanistan.
This persecution has had a long history going back to the late 1800s, and the rule of King Abdur Rahman.
He killed 63 percent of the Hazara population.
He built minarets with their heads.
Many Hazaras were sold into slavery, and many others fled the country for neighboring Iran and Pakistan.
My parents also fled to Pakistan, and settled in Quetta, where I was born.
After the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers, I got a chance to go to Afghanistan for the first time, with foreign journalists.
I was only 18, and I got a job working as an interpreter.
After four years, I felt it was safe enough to move to Afghanistan permanently, and I was working there as a documentary photographer, and I worked on many stories.
One of the most important stories that I did was the dancing boys of Afghanistan.
It is a tragic story about an appalling tradition.
It involves young kids dancing for warlords and powerful men in the society.
These boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents, and they are put to work as sex slaves.
This is Shukur.
He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord.
He was taken to another province, where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends.
When this story was published in the Washington Post, I started receiving death threats, and I was forced to leave Afghanistan, as my parents were.
Along with my family, I returned back to Quetta.
The situation in Quetta had changed dramatically since I left in 2005.
Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras, it had now turned into the most dangerous city in Pakistan.
Hazaras are confined into two small areas, and they are marginalized socially, educationally, and financially.
This is Nadir.
I had known him since my childhood.
He was injured when his van was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta.
He later died of his injuries.
Around 1,600 Hazara members had been killed in various attacks, and around 3,000 of them were injured, and many of them permanently disabled.
The attacks on the Hazara community would only get worse, so it was not surprising that many wanted to flee.
After Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Australia is home to the fourth largest population of Hazaras in the world.
When it came time to leave Pakistan, Australia seemed the obvious choice.
For much of the past century, architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine.
"Form follows function" had become modernity's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket, as it liberated architecture from the decorative, but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose.
Of course, architecture is about function, but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi, and I want to propose a completely different quality.
If form follows fiction, we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories -- stories of the people that live there, of the people that work in these buildings.
And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create.
In this sense, I'm interested in fiction not as the implausible but as the real, as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it.
Our buildings are prototypes, ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different, and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today.
Our buildings are real; they're being built.
They're an explicit engagement in physical reality and conceptual possibility.
I think of our architecture as organizational structures.
At their core is indeed structural thinking, like a system: How can we arrange things in both a functional and experiential way?
How can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives?
And how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture, while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time?
And here comes the second term into play, what I call "narrative hybrids" -- structures of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create.
So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships, both in a programmatic and functional way and in an experiential and emotive or social way.
This is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster, which I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA.
When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002, the city planners showed us this image: a forest of several hundred skyscrapers to emerge in the central business district, except at that time, only a handful of them existed.
So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about, except one thing: it would all be about verticality.
Of course, the skyscraper is vertical -- it's a profoundly hierarchical structure, the top always the best, the bottom the worst, and the taller you are, the better, so it seems.
And we wanted to ask ourselves, could a building be about a completely different quality?
Could it undo this hierarchy, and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration, rather than isolation?
So we took this needle and bent it back into itself, into a loop of interconnected activities.
Our idea was to bring all aspects of television-making into one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting, research and training, administration -- all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration.
I still very much like this image.
It reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body with all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school.
And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance, but as an organism, as a life form.
And as you start to dissect this organism, you can identify a series of primary technical clusters -- program production, broadcasting center and news.
Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters: meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas -- informal spaces for people to meet and exchange.
So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social, the human and the performative.
And of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system, to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity.
With 473,000 square meters, it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world.
It has a population of over 10,000 people, and of course, this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture.
So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model, just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant.
But of course, it's not a number, it is the people, it is a community that inhabits the building, and in order to both comprehend this, but also script this architecture, we identified five characters, hypothetical characters, and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building, thought of where they would meet, what they would experience.
So it was a way to script and design the building, but of course, also to communicate its experiences.
This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art in both New York and Beijing.
However, at the next interval, the researchers didn't put the cold air on, yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening.
It somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn't like.
The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn.
A third experiment: the slime mold was invited to explore a territory covered in oats.
It fans out in a branching pattern.
As it goes, each food node it finds, it forms a network, a connection to, and keeps foraging.
After 26 hours, it established quite a firm network between the different oats.
Now there's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oat that it started from represents the city of Tokyo, and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations.
The slime mold had replicated the Tokyo transport network —  — a complex system developed over time by community dwellings, civil engineering, urban planning.
What had taken us well over 100 years took the slime mold just over a day.
The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem.
It is a biological computer.
As such, it has been mathematically modeled, algorithmically analyzed.
It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.
World over, teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics, programming and robotics.
So the question is, how does this thing work?
It doesn't have a central nervous system.
It doesn't have a brain, yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function.
It can learn, it can remember, it can solve problems, it can make decisions.
So where does that intelligence lie?
So this is a microscopy, a video I shot, and it's about 100 times magnification, sped up about 20 times, and inside the slime mold, there is a rhythmic pulsing flow, a vein-like structure carrying cellular material, nutrients and chemical information through the cell, streaming first in one direction and then back in another.
And it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment, but without any large-scale control center.
This is where its intelligence lies.
So it's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism.
A few years ago, I set up SliMoCo, the Slime Mould Collective.
It's an online, open, democratic network for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and experimentation across disciplinary divides and across academic divides.
The Slime Mould Collective membership is self-selecting.
People have found the collective as the slime mold finds the oats.
And it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and researchers but also artists like me, architects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.
It's a very interesting, eclectic membership.
Just a few examples: an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum; a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3D printing technologies in a workshop; another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area.
Here, the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool, but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about social cohesion, communication and cooperation.
Other public engagement activities, I run lots of slime mold workshops, a creative way of engaging with the organism.
So people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do, and they design their own petri dish experiment, an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties.
Everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the Slime Mould Collective.
There's something about caves -- a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in.
As you pass through the portal between light and dark, you enter a subterranean world -- a place of perpetual gloom, of earthy smells, of hushed silence.
Long ago in Europe, ancient people also entered these underground worlds.
As witness to their passage, they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings, like this panel of humans, triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guareña in Spain.
You now walk the same path as these early artists.
And in this surreal, otherworldly place, it's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth, or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend.
When I'm in a cave, I often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark?
In this video clip, that was shot half a kilometer, or about a third of a mile, underground, in the cave of Cudon in Spain, we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexplored section of the cave.
As we crawled forward, military-style, with the ceiling getting ever lower, we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photographer, Dylan, could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera.
So while he filmed me, I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a point-and-shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion.
Half a kilometer underground.
Seriously.
What was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp?
I mean -- me, it makes sense, right?
But you know, this is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research.
I study some of the oldest art in the world.
It was created by these early artists in Europe, between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.
And the thing is that I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful, though some of it certainly is.
But what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind, of the evolution of creativity, of imagination, of abstract thought, about what it means to be human.
While all species communicate in one way or another, only we humans have really taken it to another level.
Our desire and ability to share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story.
Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange made possible, in large part, by our ability to communicate -- in particular, using graphic or written forms of communication.
The thing is, though, that we've been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed.
It's one of the things I find most fascinating about studying our deep history.
Those people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on.
They were the original shoulders.
And while a surprising number of important inventions come out of that distant time, what I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication.
There are three main types of communication, spoken, gestural -- so things like sign language -- and graphic communication.
Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral.
The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist, as an Iranian woman artist, as an Iranian woman artist living in exile.
Well, it has its pluses and minuses.
On the dark side, politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.
Every Iranian artist, in one form or another, is political.
Politics have defined our lives.
If you're living in Iran, you're facing censorship, harassment, arrest, torture -- at times, execution.
If you're living outside like me, you're faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family.
Therefore, we don't find the moral, emotional, psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility.
Oddly enough, an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice, the speaker of my people, even if I have, indeed, no access to my own country.
Also, people like myself, we're fighting two battles on different grounds.
We're being critical of the West, the perception of the West about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us, about our women, about our politics, about our religion.
We are there to take pride and insist on respect.
And at the same time, we're fighting another battle.
That is our regime, our government -- our atrocious government, [that] has done every crime in order to stay in power.
Our artists are at risk.
We are in a position of danger.
We pose a threat to the order of the government.
But ironically, this situation has empowered all of us, because we are considered, as artists, central to the cultural, political, social discourse in Iran.
We are there to inspire, to provoke, to mobilize, to bring hope to our people.
We are the reporters of our people, and are communicators to the outside world.
Art is our weapon.
Culture is a form of resistance.
I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression.
For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics.
From the fact that they are only serving one audience, mainly the Western culture.
But also, I worry about the West, because often in this country, in this Western world that we have, culture risks being a form of entertainment.
Our people depend on our artists, and culture is beyond communication.
My journey as an artist started from a very, very personal place.
I did not start to make social commentary about my country.
The Nazis invaded the Netherlands.
Their grim plans were evident.
They meant to rule by means of repression.
Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.
Only brute force remained.
It was our last resort.
My father was there to provide it.
As the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt, my father was an excellent marksman.
When he aimed, he never missed.
At this decisive moment in Dutch history my father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal near the city of Nijmegen.
He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country, his country, our country.
He fired. Nothing happened.
He fired again.
No German soldier fell to the ground.
My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank.
Hitler's troops marched on, and there was nothing my father could do about it.
Until the day my father died, he was frustrated about missing these shots.
He could have done something.
But with an old gun, not even the best marksman in the armed forces could have hit the mark.
So this story stayed with me.
Then in high school, I was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers -- soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn't know.
They liberated my birth town.
It was then that I decided I would take up the gun -- out of respect and gratitude for those men and women who came to liberate us.
From the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil.
And that is why I took up the gun -- not to shoot, not to kill, not to destroy, but to stop those who would do evil, to protect the vulnerable, to defend democratic values, to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place.
Ladies and gentlemen, I do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons.
I do not like guns.
And once you have been under fire yourself, it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about.
I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.
The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world.
Now this may sound contradictory to you.
But not only have I seen with my own eyes during my deployments in Lebanon, Sarajevo and as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence, this is also supported by cold, hard statistics.
Violence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years.
Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news, wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace.
The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages.
And occurrences of civil war and repression have declined since the end of the Cold War.
Statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era.
Why?
Why has violence decreased?
Has the human mind changed?
Well, we were talking about the human mind this morning.
Did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge, for violent rituals, for pure rage?
Or is there something else?
What is a coral and where does it come from?
Corals are born in a number of different ways, but most often by mass spawning: all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year, releasing all the eggs they've made that year into the water column, packaged into bundles with sperm cells.
And those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart.
And hopefully -- hopefully -- at the surface of the ocean, they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals.
And that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef -- so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface.
When they're fertilized, they do what any other animal egg does: divides in half again and again and again.
Taking these photos under the microscope every year is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year.
At the end of all this cell division, they turn into a swimming larva -- a little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed, but with all of the sensory systems that we have.
They can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH.
They can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound.
And they use those talents to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives.
So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life They attach in the place they find most suitable, they build a skeleton underneath themselves, they build a mouth and tentacles, and then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs.
One coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again, leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself and growing up toward the sun.
Given hundreds of years and many species, what you get is a massive limestone structure that can be seen from space in many cases, covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals.
Now, there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.
But these systems house millions and millions of other species, and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems, and it's where we're finding our new medicines.
It's how we find new sources of food.
I'm lucky enough to work on the island of Curaçao, where we still have reefs that look like this.
But, indeed, much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this.
Scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world's coral reefs, and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes.
But in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward.
My colleagues and I in Curaçao are interested in looking forward at what might be.
And we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic.
Because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long ago, we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway.
And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't.
They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet.
So in the research I do with my colleagues in Curaçao, we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage, what it's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process.
I'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done to try to answer those questions.
A few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made coral choice surveys -- different colors and different textures, and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle.
And we found that corals, even without the biology involved, still prefer white and pink, the colors of a healthy reef.
And they prefer crevices and grooves and holes, where they will be safe from being trampled or eaten by a predator.
So we can use this knowledge, we can go back and say we need to restore those factors -- that pink, that white, those crevices, those hard surfaces -- in our conservation projects.
We can also use that knowledge if we're going to put something underwater, like a sea wall or a pier.
We can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals.
Now in addition to the surfaces, we also study the chemical and microbial signals that attract corals to reefs.
Starting about six years ago, I began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled.
And I tried those one by one by one, looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach.
And we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer that will reliably cause corals to go through that settlement and attachment process.
So as we speak, my colleagues in Curaçao are testing those bacteria to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab, and to see if those coral settlers will survive better when we put them back underwater.
This is a river.
This is a stream.
This is a river.
This is happening all over the country.
There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States.
On this map, the colored areas represent water conflicts.
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well.
The reasons vary state to state, but mostly in the details.
There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone.
They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife.
They're the veins of the ecosystem, and they're often empty veins.
I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it's an archetype for the larger story.
This is Prickly Pear Creek.
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena.
It supports wild fish including cutthroat, brown and rainbow trout.
Nearly every year for more than a hundred years, it's looked like this in the summer.
How did we get here?
Well, it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana.
In short, there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people.
But as more people showed up wanting water, the folks who were there first got a little concerned, and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.
It basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream.
Oddly, a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream, and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers.
There were precedent-setting suits in 1870 and 1872, both involving Prickly Pear Creek.
And in 1921, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first, or "senior water rights."
These senior water rights are key.
The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this.
Some of these creeks have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream.
Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example, where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year.
This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology, aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.
China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago, 2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world.
Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.
We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities, Ethiopia's small farmers.
So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.
We're creating a system that serves all market actors, that creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia, we've done something rather unique, which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective, or what we call the ECX Edge.
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself.
And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work.
You've got one donor trying to develop market information, another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards, another ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.
In our approach in Ethiopia, we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem, or environment, in which trade takes place.
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system, which will initially start as an open outcry, because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.
But at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas.
So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call the remote access terminal centers -- and actually, without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things, simply see the trading that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.
At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that -- and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange -- is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country, in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.
And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system, to assure that payment is done appropriately, in the right amount and at the right time, so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.
Obviously, we work with exchange actors, and as we're developing the exchange market itself, we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework, the overarching legal framework for making this market work.
So, in fact, our proclamation is going to parliament next month.
What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country, using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers.
What this does is transforms, fundamentally, the farmers' relationship to the market.
Whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market, eight to 10 kilometers away on average, and sell whatever they happened to have, without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.
And they start to think national, and even global.
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions, but also planting decisions, on the basis of information coming from the futures price market.
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium.
So all of this will transform farmers.
It will also transform the way traders do business.
It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].
Can Ethiopia do this?
It seems very ambitious.
But it will create new opportunities.
We believe that this initiative requires great political will, and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector, and really even the underlying legal framework.
We believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.
ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium, which starts in about eight months.
The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today.
We believe that the stakes are high, but that the returns will be even greater.
ECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market in agricultural commodities.
Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.
And we feel that over the next five years, if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market, and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.
Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa's grain production, and, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.
So the potential is there.
The will is there.
The commitment is there.
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture, and to change Africa.
So, we are in the business of finding our happiness.
When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war.
That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water.
When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.
Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this.
Instead, it looks like this.
If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.
Not missiles, but microbes.
Now, part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents.
But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.
We're not ready for the next epidemic.
Let's look at Ebola.
I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges.
I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication.
And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we didn't have a system at all.
In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.
We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.
The case reports came in on paper.
It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate.
We didn't have a medical team ready to go.
We didn't have a way of preparing people.
Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers.
But even so, we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries.
And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers.
There was no one there to look at treatment approaches.
No one to look at the diagnostics.
No one to figure out what tools should be used.
As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors, processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them.
But that was never tried.
So there was a lot that was missing.
And these things are really a global failure.
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries.
But where are they situated?
I will swap the bubbles to a map.
Look, the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.
HIV exists all over the world.
Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.
Brazil has many HIV-infected.
Arab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran.
India has many because they are many.
Southeast Asia, and so on.
But, there is one part of Africa -- and the difficult thing is, at the same time, not to make a uniform statement about Africa, not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand.
On the other hand, try to say that this is not the case, because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now.
UNAIDS have done good data available, finally, about the spread of HIV.
It could be concurrency.
It could be some virus types.
It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.
After all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex, the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.
Don't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on.
But -- and if you are in an unfavorable situation, more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100.
But what we think is that it could be concurrency.
And what is concurrency?
In Sweden, we have no concurrency.
We have serial monogamy.
Vodka, New Year's Eve -- new partner for the spring.
Vodka, Midsummer's Eve -- new partner for the fall.
Vodka -- and it goes on like this, you know?
And you collect a big number of exes.
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic -- terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years.
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore, having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others.
Probably, it's a combination of this.
And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this.
You can get this chart, free.
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.
And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart, we will not only have the money, but we will also use the brain.
Then, even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number -- 10 to the power of 32.
So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant.
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.
And even if you just look at the current people, and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct, it should still have a high priority.
Now, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem, because it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp.
Think about some time in your life -- some people might never have experienced it -- but some people, there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic.
It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage.
Or when you understood something you had never done before.
Or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love.
Or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art.
Every once in a while we have these moments, and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best.
And you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time?
You just want to cling onto this.
And then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.
And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best.
Or how bad it can be at its worst.
The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be.
I think that's a big, big problem.
It's easy to say what we don't want.
Here are a number of things that we don't want -- illness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty, stunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity.
Suppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these.
We were very successful.
We got rid of all of these things.
We might end up with something like this, which is -- I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than that.
But is this really the best we can dream of?
Is this the best we can do?
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards?
And if we think about this, I think it's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives, but adding positives.
On my wish list, at least, would be: much longer, healthier lives, greater subjective well-being, enhanced cognitive capacities, more knowledge and understanding, unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits, better relationships, an unbounded potential for spiritual, moral and intellectual development.
If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change?
And this is the answer -- we would have to change.
Not just the world around us, but we, ourselves.
Not just the way we think about the world, but the way we are -- our very biology.
Human nature would have to change.
Now, when we think about changing human nature, the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies -- growth hormone therapy, cosmetic surgery, stimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, anti-depressants, anabolic steroids, artificial hearts.
It's a pretty pathetic list.
They do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition, but for most people, they don't really transform what it is to be human.
And they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that, well, sure, there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people.
But there's a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way.
It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use.
We have skin enhancements, clothing.
As far as I can see, all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing.
Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial -- caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, immune system enhancement, vision enhancement, anesthetics -- we take that very much for granted, but just think about how great progress that is -- like, having an operation before anesthetics was not fun.
Contraceptives, cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques -- that sounds ominous, but the distinction between what is a technology -- a gadget would be the archetype -- and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle.
So if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read, you're actually, literally rewriting your own brain.
You're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along.
So in a broad sense, we don't need to think about technology as only little gadgets, like these things here, but even institutions and techniques, psychological methods and so forth.
Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature.
Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later.
Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war.
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics, nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about.
Yet, not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago, but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict.
Three things stand out: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design.
What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter, how they matter, and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways, that is, how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last.
But let's start at the beginning.
Civil wars have made news headlines for many decades now, and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat.
For nearly two decades now, the news has been bad and the images have been haunting.
In Georgia, after years of stalemate, we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence in August, 2008.
This quickly escalated into a five-day war between Russia and Georgia, leaving Georgia ever more divided.
In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people.
In Sri Lanka, a decades-long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinhala majority led to a bloody climax in 2009, after perhaps as many as 100,000 people had been killed since 1983.
In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks, unprecedented levels of violence occurred between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks.
Hundreds have been killed, and more than 100,000 displaced, including many ethnic Uzbeks who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.
In the Middle East, conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues unabated, and it becomes ever more difficult to see how, just how a possible, sustainable solution can be achieved.
Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines, but the killing and displacement there continues as well, and the sheer human misery that it creates is very hard to fathom.
And in Iraq, finally, violence is on the rise again, and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections.
But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.
So are these now the images of the past?
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East, Darfur, Iraq, elsewhere, there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news.
Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War, there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars.
Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today.
The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two.
But this trend is less unambiguous.
The highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001, with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels killed every year.
The lowest number of combatant casualties occurred in 2003, with just 20,000 killed.
Despite the up and down since then, the overall trend -- and this is the important bit -- clearly points downward for the past two decades.
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be.
From over 12,000 civilians deliberately killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998, a decade later, this figure stands at 4,000.
This is a decrease by two-thirds.
This decline would be even more obvious if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a matter of just a few months.
This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed.
What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story.
They exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war, from hunger or disease, for example.
There is, for example, a project that's underway to sequence a thousand individuals -- their genomes -- from different parts of the world.
They've sequenced 185 Africans from two populations in Africa.
[They've] sequenced approximately equally [as] many people in Europe and in China.
And we can begin to say how much variance do we find, how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences.
And it's a lot: 38 million variable positions.
But we can then ask: Are there any absolute differences between Africans and non-Africans?
Perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed.
And with absolute difference -- and I mean a difference where people inside Africa at a certain position, where all individuals -- 100 percent -- have one letter, and everybody outside Africa has another letter.
And the answer to that, among those millions of differences, is that there is not a single such position.
This may be surprising.
Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so.
So we can relax the criterion a bit and say: How many positions do we find where 95 percent of people in Africa have one variant, 95 percent another variant, and the number of that is 12.
So this is very surprising.
It means that when we look at people and see a person from Africa and a person from Europe or Asia, we cannot, for a single position in the genome with 100 percent accuracy, predict what the person would carry.
And only for 12 positions can we hope to be 95 percent right.
This may be surprising, because we can, of course, look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from.
So what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see -- facial features, skin color, hair structure -- are not determined by single genes with big effects, but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world.
There is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that I think is worthwhile to consider, and that is that, in a very literal sense, they're really on the surface of our bodies.
They are what we just said -- facial features, hair structure, skin color.
There are also a number of features that vary between continents like that that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest, or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with microbes that try to invade our bodies.
But so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment, in a direct confrontation, if you like.
It's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them.
But if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don't directly interact with the environment -- our kidneys, our livers, our hearts -- by just looking at these organs, where in the world they would come from.
So there's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in Africa, and that is that when those humans emerged around 100,000 years ago or so, they were not alone on the planet.
There were other forms of humans around, most famously perhaps, Neanderthals -- these robust forms of humans, compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right -- that existed in Western Asia and Europe since several hundreds of thousands of years.
So an interesting question is, what happened when we met?
What happened to the Neanderthals?
And to begin to answer such questions, my research group -- since over 25 years now -- works on methods to extract DNA from remains of Neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old.
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA, how you convert it to a form you can sequence.
You have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with DNA from yourself.
And this then, in conjunction with these methods that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly, allowed us last year to present the first version of the Neanderthal genome, so that any one of you can now look on the Internet, on the Neanderthal genome, or at least on the 55 percent of it that we've been able to reconstruct so far.
And you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today.
And one question that you may then want to ask is, what happened when we met?
Did we mix or not?
And the way to ask that question is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today.
So we then look to do this with pairs of individuals, starting with two Africans, looking at the two African genomes, finding places where they differ from each other, and in each case ask: What is a Neanderthal like?
Does it match one African or the other African?
And it was a revelation.
We traveled through five seas, two oceans, nine ports, and I learned a lot about shipping.
And one of the first things that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was, where are all the people?
I have friends in the Navy who tell me they sail with 1,000 sailors at a time, but on Kendal there were only 21 crew.
Now that's because shipping is very efficient.
Containerization has made it very efficient.
Ships have automation now.
They can operate with small crews.
But it also means that, in the words of a port chaplain I once met, the average seafarer you're going to find on a container ship is either tired or exhausted, because the pace of modern shipping is quite punishing for what the shipping calls its human element, a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize sounds a little bit inhuman.
So most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time.
They don't have time to relax.
They're at sea for months at a time, and even when they're on board, they don't have access to what a five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet.
And another thing that surprised me when I got on board Kendal was who I was sitting next to -- Not the queen; I can't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait -- But around that dining table in the officer's saloon, I was sitting next to a Burmese guy, I was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian.
On the next table was a Chinese guy, and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos.
So that was a normal working ship.
Now how is that possible?
Because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last 60 years, when most of the general public stopped noticing it, was something called an open registry, or a flag of convenience.
Ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag registry.
You can get a flag from the landlocked nation of Bolivia, or Mongolia, or North Korea, though that's not very popular.
So we have these very multinational, global, mobile crews on ships.
And that was a surprise to me.
And when we got to pirate waters, down the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and into the Indian Ocean, the ship changed.
And that was also shocking, because suddenly, I realized, as the captain said to me, that I had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship.
We were no longer allowed on deck.
There were double pirate watches.
And at that time, there were those 544 seafarers being held hostage, and some of them were held hostage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience.
Not all of them, but some of them were, because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners, it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience.
What else does our sea blindness mask?
Well, if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel, you'll see very black smoke.
And that's because shipping has very tight margins, and they want cheap fuel, so they use something called bunker fuel, which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the refinery, or just one step up from asphalt.
I study ants in the desert, in the tropical forest and in my kitchen, and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.
I've recently realized that ants are using interactions differently in different environments, and that got me thinking that we could learn from this about other systems, like brains and data networks that we engineer, and even cancer.
So what all these systems have in common is that there's no central control.
An ant colony consists of sterile female workers -- those are the ants you see walking around — and then one or more reproductive females who just lay the eggs.
They don't give any instructions.
Even though they're called queens, they don't tell anybody what to do.
So in an ant colony, there's no one in charge, and all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple interactions.
Ants interact using smell.
They smell with their antennae, and they interact with their antennae, so when one ant touches another with its antennae, it can tell, for example, if the other ant and what task that other ant has been doing.
So here you see a lot of ants moving around and interacting in a lab arena that's connected by tubes to two other arenas.
So when one ant meets another, it doesn't matter which ant it meets, and they're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message.
All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants.
And all of these interactions, taken together, produce a network.
So this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena, and it's this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony, like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest, or how many are going out to forage.
A brain actually works in the same way, but what's great about ants is that you can see the whole network as it happens.
There are more than 12,000 species of ants, in every conceivable environment, and they're using interactions differently to meet different environmental challenges.
So one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs, just what it takes to run the system.
And another environmental challenge is resources, finding them and collecting them.
In the desert, operating costs are high because water is scarce, and the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert have to spend water to get water.
So an ant outside foraging, searching for seeds in the hot sun, just loses water into the air.
But the colony gets its water by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds that they eat.
So in this environment, interactions are used to activate foraging.
An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning foragers, and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel, into the nest, and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.
This makes sense for the ant colony, because the more food there is out there, the more quickly the foragers find it, the faster they come back, and the more foragers they send out.
The system works to stay stopped, unless something positive happens.
So interactions function to activate foragers.
And we've been studying the evolution of this system.
First of all, there's variation.
It turns out that colonies are different.
On dry days, some colonies forage less, so colonies are different in how they manage this trade-off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds.
And we're trying to understand why some colonies forage less than others by thinking about ants as neurons, using models from neuroscience.
I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise.
I soared through the galaxy driving a huge starship with a crew made up of people from all over this world, many different races, many different cultures, many different heritages, all working together, and our mission was to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.
Well —  — I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America, boldly going to a strange new world, seeking new opportunities.
My mother was born in Sacramento, California.
My father was a San Franciscan.
They met and married in Los Angeles, and I was born there.
I was four years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941 by Japan, and overnight, the world was plunged into a world war.
America suddenly was swept up by hysteria.
Japanese-Americans, American citizens of Japanese ancestry, were looked on with suspicion and fear and with outright hatred simply because we happened to look like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.
And the hysteria grew and grew until in February 1942, the president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, ordered all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast of America to be summarily rounded up with no charges, with no trial, with no due process.
Due process, this is a core pillar of our justice system.
That all disappeared.
We were to be rounded up and imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps in some of the most desolate places in America: the blistering hot desert of Arizona, the sultry swamps of Arkansas, the wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and two of the most desolate places in California.
On April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday, and just a few weeks after my birthday, my parents got my younger brother, my baby sister and me up very early one morning, and they dressed us hurriedly.
My brother and I were in the living room looking out the front window, and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.
They carried bayonets on their rifles.
They stomped up the front porch and banged on the door.
My father answered it, and the soldiers ordered us out of our home.
My father gave my brother and me small luggages to carry, and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out, and when my mother finally came out, she had our baby sister in one arm, a huge duffel bag in the other, and tears were streaming down both her cheeks.
I will never be able to forget that scene.
It is burned into my memory.
We were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other Japanese-American families.
There were guards stationed at both ends of each car, as if we were criminals.
We were taken two thirds of the way across the country, rocking on that train for four days and three nights, to the swamps of Arkansas.
I still remember the barbed wire fence that confined me.
I remember the tall sentry tower with the machine guns pointed at us.
I remember the searchlight that followed me when I made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine.
But to five-year-old me, I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way for me to pee.
I was a child, too young to understand the circumstances of my being there.
Children are amazingly adaptable.
What would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps.
And you even find a church.
And on the 30th floor, there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed.
From the outside, behind this always-changing facade, you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic, intuitive way that responds directly to their needs.
Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria, to a community called Makoko, a slum where 150,000 people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.
While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place, when you see it from above, there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home.
From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area.
When out on the water, it's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living.
Even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house, selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.
Behind every window and door frame, you'll see a small child peering back at you, and while Makoko seems to be packed with people, what's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building.
The population growth in Nigeria, and especially in these areas like Makoko, are painful reminders of how out of control things really are.
In Makoko, very few systems and infrastructures exist.
Electricity is rigged and freshest water comes from self-built wells throughout the area.
This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water, so fishing and boat-making are common professions.
You'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area, like barbershops, CD and DVD stores, movie theaters, tailors, everything is there.
There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or to be associated with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.
On this particular evening, I came across this live band dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.
They were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator for all of the community to enjoy.
By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black, save for a small lightbulb or a fire.
What originally brought me to Makoko was this project from a friend of mine, Kunlé Adeyemi, who recently finished building this three-story floating school for the kids in Makoko.
With this entire village existing on the water, public space is very limited, so now that the school is finished, the ground floor is a playground for the kids, but when classes are out, the platform is just like a town square, where the fishermen mend their nets and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.
Another place I'd like to share with you is the Zabbaleen in Cairo.
They're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper Egypt in the '40s, and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over Cairo.
For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities, but in the early 1980s, they settled on the Mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city.
Today, they live in this area, approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people, who live in this community of self-built multi-story houses where up to three generations live in one structure.
While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid, each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for garbage-related activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space.
I find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there, like this very distinguished man who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him, or like these two young men who are sitting and chatting amongst these tons of garbage.
While to most of us, living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable, to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just a different type of normal.
In all these places I've talked about today, what I do find fascinating is that there's really no such thing as normal, and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation.
Throughout the day, it's quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets, just like this engagement party.
In this tradition, the bride-to-be displays all of their belongings, which they soon bring to their new husband.
Unfortunately, global carbon emissions from deforestation now equals the global transportation sector.
That's all ships, airplanes, trains and automobiles combined.
So it's understandable that policy negotiators have been working hard to reduce deforestation, but they're doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science.
If you don't know where the carbon is exactly, in detail, how can you know what you're losing?
Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system.
With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks of tropical forests in utter detail.
The red shows, obviously, closed-canopy tropical forest, and then you see the cookie cutting, or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.
It's like cutting a cake except this cake is about whale deep.
And yet, we can zoom in and see the forest and the trees at the same time.
And what's amazing is, even though we flew very high above this forest, later on in analysis, we can go in and actually experience the treetrops, leaf by leaf, branch by branch, just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves.
We've been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon geographies in high resolution in faraway places like the Amazon Basin and not-so-faraway places like the United States and Central America.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high-resolution, first-time tour of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.
The colors are going to be going from red to blue.
Red is extremely high carbon stocks, your largest cathedral forests you can imagine, and blue are very low carbon stocks.
And let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place, totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography until today.
We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stocks in red, and the Amazon River and floodplain cutting right through it.
We can go to an area of utter devastation caused by deforestation in blue, and the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange.
We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon geography ends as we go up into the mountain system.
And we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon.
It's a watery dreamworld akin to Jim Cameron's "Avatar."
We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries, Panama, and see also a huge range of carbon variation, from high in red to low in blue.
Unfortunately, most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands, but what you see that's left, in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds, is the stuff that's up in the mountains.
One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen.
You're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal.
That's in the reds and yellows.
The canal authorities are using force to protect their watershed and global commerce.
This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development.
It's really advancing our ability to save forests and to curb climate change.
My second question: How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rainforest?
Let me tell you, I spend a lot of time in these places, and we're seeing the climate changing already.
Temperatures are increasing, and what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts, recurring droughts.
The 2010 mega-drought is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe.
The Amazon was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself dried up partially, as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide.
What we found is that in very remote areas, these droughts are having a big negative impact on tropical forests.
For example, these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.
This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil, totally unexplored, almost totally unknown scientifically.
So what we think, as Earth scientists, is species are going to have to migrate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to minimize their exposure to climate change.
One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.
Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash in the forest created by gold miners.
To do that, we need to charter a research boat.
This is the James Cook, an ocean-class research vessel moored up in Tenerife.
Looks beautiful, right?
Great, if you're not a great mariner.
Sometimes it looks a little more like this.
This is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples.
Everyone's scurrying around, and I get terribly seasick, so it's not always a lot of fun, but overall it is.
So we've got to become a really good mapper to do this.
You don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere.
It is global and it is deep, but we need to really find the right places.
We just saw a global map, and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year.
This was a seven-week cruise, and this is us, having made our own maps of about 75,000 square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks, but that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor.
We're traveling from west to east, over part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big-scale map, but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest.
So with the maps that we make on board, we get about 100-meter resolution, enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment, but not enough to see very much.
To do that, we need to fly remotely-operated vehicles about five meters off the seafloor.
And if we do that, we can get maps that are one-meter resolution down thousands of meters.
Here is a remotely-operated vehicle, You can see an array of big lights on the top.
There are high-definition cameras, manipulator arms, and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples.
Here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise, plunging down into the ocean.
We go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships.
And we go down, and these are the kinds of things you see.
These are deep sea sponges, meter scale.
This is a swimming holothurian -- it's a small sea slug, basically.
This is slowed down.
Most of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up, because all of this takes a lot of time.
This is a beautiful holothurian as well.
And this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise.
I've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised.
This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy, and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past.
It's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate, if you like.
This wasn't what we were looking for.
We were looking for corals, deep sea corals.
You're going to see a picture of one in a moment.
It's small, about five centimeters high.
It's made of calcium carbonate, so you can see its tentacles there, moving in the ocean currents.
An organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years.
And as it grows, it takes in chemicals from the ocean.
And the chemicals, or the amount of chemicals, depends on the temperature; it depends on the pH, it depends on the nutrients.
And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton, we can then go back, collect fossil specimens, and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past.
And here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system, and we put it into a sampling container.
We can do this very carefully, I should add.
Some of these organisms live even longer.
This is a black coral called Leiopathes, an image taken by my colleague, Brendan Roark, about 500 meters below Hawaii.
Now the traditional method of surveying carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops where you might find an orangutan or its nest.
Now as you can imagine, that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly process, so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
So we were very excited when we captured our first pair of orangutan nests on camera.
And this is it; this is the first ever picture of orangutan nests taken with a drone.
Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia, and we're now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we've collected so far.
But nests are not the only objects these drones can detect.
This is a wild orangutan happily feeding on top of a palm tree, seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead, not once but several times.
We've also taken pictures of other animals including forest buffalos in Gabon, elephants, and even turtle nests.
But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves, we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in, because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats.
Sometimes, we zoom out a little and look at other things that might be happening in the landscape.
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.
Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation in that part of the world, so we wanted to use this new drone technology to keep track of the spread of these plantations in Southeast Asia.
But drones could also be used to keep track of illegal logging activities.
This is a recently logged forest, again in Sumatra.
You could even still see the processed wooden planks left on the ground.
But perhaps the most exciting part about taking pictures from the air is we could later stitch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape, and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change, to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding, where forests might be contracting, or where fires might be breaking out.
Aerial images could also be processed to produce three-dimensional computer models of forests.
Now these models are not just visually appealing, but they are also geometrically accurate, which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees, calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation, and so on, all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests.
Recently, we've also begun experimenting with thermal imaging cameras.
Now these cameras can detect heat-emitting objects from the ground, and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.
So I've told you quite a lot about what conservation drones are, how you might operate one of these drones, and what a drone could do for you.
I will now tell you where conservation drones are being used around the world.
We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.
We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights.
Since then, we've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world, and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations.
Perhaps the best and most rewarding part about working with these collaborators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our drones.
Building drones for us is a constant work in progress.
We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range, their ruggedness, and the amount of payload they can carry.
We also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones.
I had, to me, a fascinating job writing about world affairs, but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think -- or really, to understand if I was truly happy.
And so, I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto, Japan, which was the place that had long exerted a strong, really mysterious gravitational pull on me.
Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it; I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.
But it's also, as you all know, a beautiful city encircled by hills, filled with more than 2,000 temples and shrines, where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more.
And quite soon after I moved there, I ended up where I still am with my wife, formerly our kids, in a two-room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle, no car, no TV I can understand, and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist, so clearly this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement
or for social diversion.
But I realized that it gives me what I prize most, which is days and hours.
I have never once had to use a cell phone there.
I almost never have to look at the time, and every morning when I wake up, really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow.
And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises, as it will, more than once, when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression, or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway, I know, in my bones, that it's the time I've spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.
I'll always be a traveler -- my livelihood depends on it -- but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world.
I once got on a plane in Frankfurt, Germany, and a young German woman came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about 30 minutes, and then she just turned around and sat still for 12 hours.
She didn't once turn on her video monitor, she never pulled out a book, she didn't even go to sleep, she just sat still, and something of her clarity and calm really imparted itself to me.
I've noticed more and more people taking conscious measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives.
Some people go to black-hole resorts where they'll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their laptop to the front desk on arrival.
Some people I know, just before they go to sleep, instead of scrolling through their messages or checking out YouTube, just turn out the lights and listen to some music, and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much refreshed.
I was once fortunate enough to drive into the high, dark mountains behind Los Angeles, where the great poet and singer and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen was living and working for many years as a full-time monk in the Mount Baldy Zen Center.
And I wasn't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of 77, to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of "Old Ideas," went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world, hit the top five in nine others.
Something in us, I think, is crying out for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that.
who take the time and trouble to sit still.
And I think many of us have the sensation, I certainly do, that we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen, and it's noisy and it's crowded and it's changing with every second, and that screen is our lives.
And it's only by stepping back, and then further back, and holding still, that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture.
And a few people do that for us by going nowhere.
So, in an age of acceleration, nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow.
And in an age of distraction, nothing is so luxurious as paying attention.
And in an age of constant movement, nothing is so urgent as sitting still.
So you can go on your next vacation to Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans; I bet you'll have a wonderful time.
But, if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope, in love with the world, I think you might want to try considering going nowhere.
I'm a garbage man.
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man, because I absolutely hate waste.
I hope, within the next 10 minutes, to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life.
And I'd like to start at the very beginning.
Think back when you were just a kid.
How did look at the stuff in your life?
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules: It's my stuff if I saw it first.
The entire pile is my stuff if I'm building something.
The more stuff that's mine, the better.
And of course, it's your stuff if it's broken.
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry, it's become pretty clear to me that we don't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults.
And let me tell you why I have that perspective.
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people's discarded stuff.
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff, but it's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent.
In fact, the United Nations estimates that there's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream.
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth, that number well more than doubles.
And of course, the more developed the country, the bigger these mountains.
Now when you see these mountains, most people think of garbage.
We see above-ground mines.
And the reason we see mines is because there's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place.
And it's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams.
Because as we've heard all week at TED, the world's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff.
And of course, they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted.
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day?
It's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals.
And the metals, we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world.
And the plastics, we get from oil, which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract.
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we're already starting to see today.
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff, particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner.
Most of what's extracted from our end-of-life stuff, if it makes it to a recycler, are the metals.
To put that in perspective -- and I'm using steel as a proxy here for metals, because it's the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler, probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose.
Plastics are a whole other story: well less than 10 percent are recovered.
In fact, it's more like five percent.
Most of it's incinerated or landfilled.
Now most people think that's because plastics are a throw-away material, have very little value.
But actually, plastics are several times more valuable than steel.
And there's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel.
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material?
So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built, from one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional and even four-dimensional systems.
So in one-dimensional systems -- this is a project called the self-folding proteins.
And the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein -- in this case it's the crambin protein -- you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions -- and you break that down into a series of components.
And then we embed elastic.
And when I throw this up into the air and catch it, it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.
And this gives us a tangible model of the three-dimensional protein and how it folds and all of the intricacies of the geometry.
So we can study this as a physical, intuitive model.
And we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems -- so flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures.
In three dimensions, we did a project last year at TEDGlobal with Autodesk and Arthur Olson where we looked at autonomous parts -- so individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own.
And we built 500 of these glass beakers.
They had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched.
And we gave them away to all the TEDsters.
And so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.
This is the polio virus.
You shake it hard and it breaks apart.
And then you shake it randomly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own.
And this is demonstrating that through random energy, we can build non-random shapes.
We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale.
Last year at TED Long Beach, we built an installation that builds installations.
The idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?
So we built a large rotating chamber, and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower, adding energy to the system and getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works and how we could use this as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products.
So remember, I said 4D.
So today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project, which is a collaboration with Stratasys, and it's called 4D printing.
The idea behind 4D printing is that you take multi-material 3D printing -- so you can deposit multiple materials -- and you add a new capability, which is transformation, that right off the bed, the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.
And this is like robotics without wires or motors.
So you completely print this part, and it can transform into something else.
We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg.
Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the Higgs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years, and this is a very long time.
It's even longer than the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.
Even so, we will be long gone by then.
In about five billion years, our sun will become a red giant, as large as the Earth's orbit, and our Earth will be kaput, and in a thousand billion years, if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate, you will not even be able to see as far as your toes, because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light.
So it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.
But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Higgs field is because I want to address the question, why is the Higgs boson mass so special?
Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition?
Theoretical physicists always ask "why" questions.
More than how a phenomenon works, theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works.
We think that this these "why" questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature.
And indeed, a possible answer to my question opens up new universes, literally.
It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles, and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws.
And in this context, you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.
Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse.
It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach.
In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach, and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30, 35 degrees.
And the reason is simple: because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.
As a result, the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value, near to collapse.
And something similar could happen for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.
In the majority of bubble universes, the Higgs mass could be around the critical value, near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field, because of two competing effects, just as in the case of sand.
My story does not have an end, because we still don't know the end of the story.
This is science in progress, and to solve the mystery, we need more data, and hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues to this story.
Just one number, the Higgs boson mass, and yet, out of this number we learn so much.
I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles are all there is in the universe, even beyond the domain explored so far.
From this, we discovered that the Higgs field that permeates space-time may be standing on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse, and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach, the multiverse.
But I don't know if my hypothesis is right.
That's how physics works: A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley.
But whichever it turns out to be, there is one thing I'm sure of: The journey will be full of surprises.
It is actually a reality today that you can download products from the Web -- product data, I should say, from the Web -- perhaps tweak it and personalize it to your own preference or your own taste, and have that information sent to a desktop machine that will fabricate it for you on the spot.
We can actually build for you, very rapidly, a physical object.
And the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing, or 3D printing.
This is a 3D printer.
They have been around for almost 30 years now, which is quite amazing to think of, but they're only just starting to filter into the public arena.
And typically, you would take data, like the data of a pen here, which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D, and we would pass that data with material into a machine.
And a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built.
And we can take out the physical product, and ready to use, or to, perhaps, assemble into something else.
But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years, why don't we know about them?
Because typically they've been too inefficient, inaccessible, they've not been fast enough, they've been quite expensive.
But today, it is becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful.
Many barriers are breaking down.
That means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines, if not this minute.
And it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing, and most certainly our lives, our businesses and the lives of our children.
So how does it work?
It typically reads CAD data, which is a product design data created on professional product design programs.
And here you can see an engineer -- it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer -- create a product in 3D.
And this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into two-dimensional representations of that product all the way through -- almost like slicing it like salami.
And that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine, starting at the base of the product and depositing material, layer upon layer, infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer in an additive process.
And this material that's deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form.
And the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.
In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.
It's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.
And over time -- quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours -- we can build a physical product, ready to take out of the machine and use.
And this is quite an extraordinary idea, but it is reality today.
So all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way.
They were all 3D printed.
And you can see, they're ranging from shoes, rings that were made out of stainless steal, phone covers out of plastic, all the way through to spinal implants, for example, that were created out of medical-grade titanium, and engine parts.
But what you'll notice about all of these products is they're very, very intricate.
The design is quite extraordinary.
Because we're taking this data in 3D form, slicing it up before it gets past the machine, we can actually create structures that are more intricate than any other manufacturing technology -- or, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.
And you can create parts with moving components, hinges, parts within parts.
So in some cases, we can abolish totally the need for manual labor.
It sounds great.
It is great.
We can have 3D printers today that build structures like these.
This is almost three meters high.
And this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness -- slowly growing this structure.
This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.
And you can actually walk into it.
And on the other end of the spectrum, this is a microstructure.
It's created depositing layers of about four microns.
So really the resolution is quite incredible.
The detail that you can get today is quite amazing.
So who's using it?
Typically, because we can create products very rapidly, it's been used by product designers, or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design.
And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse.
