Some of my most won ##der ##ful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother ##, Mama ##r ##, in our four ##- ##family home in Brooklyn ##, New York ##.
Her apartment was an oa ##sis ##.
It was a place where I could s ##nea ##k a cup of coffee ##, which was really warm milk with just a touch of ca ##ffe ##ine ##.
She loved life ##.
And although she worked in a factory ##, she saved her penn ##ies and she traveled to Europe ##.
And I remember por ##ing over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music ##.
And then ##, when I was eight and she was 60 ##, something changed ##.
She no longer worked or traveled ##.
She no longer dance ##d ##.
There were no more coffee times ##.
My mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn ##' ##t make a diagnosis ##.
And my father ##, who worked at night ##, would spend every afternoon with her ##, just to make sure she at ##e ##.
Her care became all ##- ##cons ##umi ##ng for our family ##.
And by the time a diagnosis was made ##, she was in a deep spiral ##.
Now many of you will recognize her symptoms ##.
My grandmother had depression ##.
A deep ##, life ##- ##alter ##ing depression ##, from which she never recovered ##.
And back then ##, so little was known about depression ##.
But even today ##, 50 years later ##, there ##' ##s still so much more to learn ##.
Today ##, we know that women are 70 percent more likely to experience depression over their lifetime ##s compared with men ##.
And even with this high pre ##valence ##, women are mis ##dia ##gnose ##d between 30 and 50 percent of the time ##.
Now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms of fat ##igue ##, sleep dis ##tur ##ban ##ce ##, pain and an ##xie ##ty compared with men ##.
And these symptoms are often over ##lo ##oked as symptoms of depression ##.
And it isn ##' ##t only depression in which these sex differences occur ##, but they occur across so many diseases ##.
So it ##' ##s my grandmother ##' ##s struggle ##s that have really led me on a life ##long quest ##.
And today ##, I lead a center in which the mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women ##.
Today ##, we know that every cell has a sex ##.
Now ##, that ##' ##s a term coin ##ed by the Institute of Medicine ##.
And what it means is that men and women are different down to the cell ##ular and molecular levels ##.
It means that we ##' ##re different across all of our organ ##s ##.
From our brain ##s to our heart ##s ##, our lung ##s ##, our joint ##s ##.
Now ##, it was only 20 years ago that we hard ##ly had any data on women ##' ##s health beyond our rep ##rodu ##ctive functions ##.
But then in 1993 ##, the N ##IH Rev ##ital ##ization Act was signed into law ##.
And what this law did was it mandate ##d that women and minori ##ties be included in clinical trials that were funded by the National Institute ##s of Health ##.
And in many ways ##, the law has worked ##.
Women are now routine ##ly included in clinical studies ##, and we ##' ##ve learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease ##.
But re ##marka ##bly ##, what we have learned about these differences is often over ##lo ##oked ##.
So ##, we have to ask our ##sel ##ves the question ##: Why leave women ##' ##s health to chance ##?
And we ##' ##re leaving it to chance in two ways ##.
The first is that there is so much more to learn and we ##' ##re not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences ##.
And the second is that we aren ##' ##t taking what we have learned ##, and routine ##ly apply ##ing it in clinical care ##.
We are just not doing enough ##.
So ##, I ##' ##m going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have impact ##ed the health of women ##, and where we need to do more ##.
Let ##' ##s start with heart disease ##.
When I was nine years old ##, my mo ##m asked me what I would want my house to look like ##, and I drew this fair ##y mu ##sh ##room ##.
And then she actually built it ##.
I don ##' ##t think I realized this was so unusual at the time ##, and may ##be I still haven ##' ##t ##, because I ##' ##m still design ##ing houses ##.
This is a six ##- ##stor ##y be ##sp ##oke home on the island of Bali ##.
It ##' ##s built almost entirely from ba ##mbo ##o ##.
The living room over ##lo ##oks the valley from the fourth floor ##.
You enter the house by a bridge ##.
It can get hot in the trop ##ics ##, so we make big cu ##rvi ##ng roof ##s to catch the br ##ee ##zes ##.
But some rooms have tall windows to keep the air condition ##ing in and the bug ##s out ##.
This room we left open ##.
We made an air ##- ##con ##dition ##ed ##, tente ##d bed ##.
And one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room ##.
Boxing off an area with tall walls just didn ##' ##t feel right ##, so instead ##, we made this giant wo ##ven pod ##.
Now ##, we do have all the necessary lu ##xu ##ries ##, like bat ##hro ##oms ##.
This one is a basket in the corner of the living room ##, and I ##' ##ve got tell you ##, some people actually he ##sita ##te to use it ##.
We have not quite figure ##d out our acoustic insula ##tion ##.
So there are lots of things that we ##' ##re still working on ##, but one thing I have learned is that ba ##mbo ##o will treat you well if you use it right ##.
It ##' ##s actually a wild grass ##.
It grows on otherwise un ##pro ##duct ##ive land - ##- deep ra ##vine ##s ##, mountains ##ides ##.
It lives off of rain ##water ##, spring water ##, sun ##light ##, and of the 1 ##, ##45 ##0 species of ba ##mbo ##o that grow across the world ##, we use just seven of them ##.
That ##' ##s my dad ##.
He ##' ##s the one who got me building with ba ##mbo ##o ##, and he is standing in a c ##lum ##p of Den ##dro ##cala ##mus asp ##er niger that he planted just seven years ago ##.
Each year ##, it sends up a new generation of shoot ##s ##.
That shoot ##, we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week ##, so we ##' ##re talking about sustainable timber in three years ##.
Now ##, we har ##vest from hundreds of family ##- ##own ##ed c ##lum ##ps ##.
Bet ##ung ##, as we call it ##, it ##' ##s really long ##, up to 18 meters of usa ##ble length ##.
Try getting that truck down the mountain ##.
And it ##' ##s strong ##: it has the ten ##sil ##e strength of steel ##, the com ##press ##ive strength of concrete ##.
Slam four tons straight down on a pole ##, and it can take it ##.
Because it ##' ##s holl ##ow ##, it ##' ##s light ##weight ##, light enough to be lift ##ed by just a few men ##, or ##, apparently ##, one woman ##.
And when my father built Green School in Bali ##, he chose ba ##mbo ##o for all of the buildings on campus ##, because he saw it as a promise ##.
But there are still some unique traits ##.
I mean ##, why would you want to do all these things for real ##?
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning ##; the protein is bio ##deg ##rada ##ble and bio ##com ##pati ##ble ##.
And you see here a picture of a tissue section ##.
And so what does that mean ##, that it ##' ##s bio ##deg ##rada ##ble and bio ##com ##pati ##ble ##?
You can im ##plant it in the body without need ##ing to ret ##rie ##ve what is im ##plant ##ed ##.
W ##hic ##h means that all the devices that you ##' ##ve seen before and all the formats ##, in principle ##, can be im ##plant ##ed and disa ##ppe ##ar ##.
And what you see there in that tissue section ##, in fact ##, is you see that reflect ##or tape ##.
So ##, much like you ##' ##re seen at night by a car ##, then the idea is that you can see ##, if you ill ##umi ##nate tissue ##, you can see deep ##er parts of tissue because there is that reflect ##ive tape there that is made out of sil ##k ##.
And you see there ##, it gets rein ##teg ##rated in tissue ##.
And rein ##teg ##ration in the human body is not the only thing ##, but rein ##teg ##ration in the environment is important ##.
So you have a clock ##, you have protein ##, and now a sil ##k cup like this can be thrown away without gu ##ilt - ##- unlike the pol ##yst ##yre ##ne cup ##s that un ##fort ##una ##tely fill our land ##fil ##ls every ##day ##.
It ##' ##s edib ##le ##, so you can do smart pack ##aging around food that you can co ##ok with the food ##.
It doesn ##' ##t taste good ##, so I ##' ##m going to need some help with that ##.
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle ##.
Silk ##, during its self ##- ##asse ##mb ##ly process ##, acts like a co ##co ##on for biological matter ##.
And so if you change the re ##ci ##pe ##, and you add things when you pour - ##- so you add things to your liquid sil ##k solution - ##- where these things are enzyme ##s or anti ##bod ##ies or va ##cci ##nes ##, the self ##- ##asse ##mb ##ly process preserve ##s the biological function of these do ##pan ##ts ##.
So it makes the materials environmental ##ly active and interactive ##.
So that s ##cre ##w that you thought about before ##hand can actually be used to s ##cre ##w a bone together - ##- a frac ##ture ##d bone together - ##- and deliver drugs at the same ##, while your bone is he ##aling ##, for example ##.
Or you could put drugs in your wall ##et and not in your fri ##dge ##.
So we ##' ##ve made a sil ##k card with pen ##ici ##llin in it ##.
And we stored pen ##ici ##llin at 60 degrees C ##, so 140 degrees Fa ##hren ##heit ##, for two months without loss of ef ##fica ##cy of the pen ##ici ##llin ##.
And so that could be - ##- ##- that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered ref ##rige ##rated came ##ls ##. And of course ##, there ##' ##s no use in storage if you can ##' ##t use [ ##it ##] ##.
And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have ##, that they ##' ##re programma ##bly de ##grada ##ble ##.
And so what you see there is the difference ##.
In the top ##, you have a film that has been programme ##d not to de ##grade ##, and in the bottom ##, a film that has been programme ##d to de ##grade in water ##.
And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it ##.
So it allows for the recovery of what we ##' ##ve stored before ##.
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for rein ##teg ##ration in the environment in all of these formats that you ##' ##ve seen ##.
So the th ##read of discovery that we have really is a th ##read ##.
We ##' ##re im ##pass ##ione ##d with this idea that whatever you want to do ##, whether you want to replace a vei ##n or a bone ##, or may ##be be more sustainable in micro ##ele ##ct ##roni ##cs ##, perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without gu ##ilt ##, may ##be carry your drugs in your poc ##ket ##, deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert ##, the answer may be in a th ##read of sil ##k ##.
Now ##, I mentioned that there are two definition ##s of re ##wil ##ding that interest me ##.
The other one is the re ##wil ##ding of human life ##.
And I don ##' ##t see this as an alternative to civili ##zation ##.
I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology ##, as we ##' ##re doing now ##, but at the same time ##, if we choose ##, have access to a riche ##r and wilde ##r life of adventure when we want to because there would be won ##der ##ful ##, re ##wil ##ded habitats ##.
And the opportunities for this are developing more rapidly than you might think possible ##.
There ##' ##s one estimate which suggests that in the United States ##, two third ##s of the land which was once forest ##ed and then cleared has become ref ##ores ##ted as log ##gers and farmers have retreat ##ed ##, particularly from the eastern half of the country ##.
There ##' ##s another one which suggests that 30 million hectares of land in Europe ##, an area the size of Poland ##, will be va ##cated by farmers between 2000 and 2030 ##.
Now ##, faced with opportunities like that ##, does it not seem a little una ##mbit ##ious to be thinking only of bringing back wol ##ves ##, ly ##n ##x ##, bears ##, be ##aver ##s ##, bis ##on ##, boa ##r ##, mo ##ose ##, and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across Europe ##?
Per ##ha ##ps we should also start thinking about the return of some of our lost meg ##afa ##una ##.
What meg ##afa ##una ##, you say ##?
Well ##, every continent had one ##, apart from Antarctica ##.
When Tra ##fal ##gar Square in London was ex ##ca ##vated ##, the river grave ##ls there were found to be st ##uff ##ed with the bones of hip ##pop ##ota ##mus ##, r ##hino ##s ##, ele ##pha ##nts ##, hy ##enas ##, lion ##s ##.
Yes ##, la ##dies and gent ##lemen ##, there were lion ##s in Tra ##fal ##gar Square long before Nelson ##' ##s Col ##um ##n was built ##.
All these species lived here in the last inter ##gla ##cial period ##, when temperatures were pretty similar to our own ##.
It ##' ##s not climate ##, largely ##, which has got ri ##d of the world ##' ##s meg ##afa ##unas ##.
It ##' ##s pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so ##.
And even so ##, you can still see the sh ##adow ##s of these great be ##ast ##s in our current e ##cos ##ystem ##s ##.
Why is it that so many de ##cid ##uo ##us trees are able to sp ##rout from whatever point the tr ##unk is broken ##?
Why is it that they can with ##stand the loss of so much of their bar ##k ##?
Why do under ##stor ##y trees ##, which are subject to lower she ##er forces from the wind and have to carry less weight than the big can ##op ##y trees ##, why are they so much tou ##ghe ##r and hard ##er to break than the can ##op ##y trees are ##?
Elephant ##s ##.
They are ele ##pha ##nt ##- ##ada ##pted ##.
In Europe ##, for example ##, they evolved to res ##ist the straight ##- ##tus ##ked ele ##pha ##nt ##, ele ##pha ##s anti ##quus ##, which was a great be ##ast ##.
It was related to the Asian ele ##pha ##nt ##, but it was a temp ##erate animal ##, a temp ##erate forest creature ##.
It was a lot bigger than the Asian ele ##pha ##nt ##.
But why is it that some of our common sh ##rub ##s have spin ##es which seem to be over ##- ##eng ##ine ##ered to res ##ist bro ##ws ##ing by dee ##r ##?
Per ##ha ##ps because they evolved to res ##ist bro ##ws ##ing by r ##hino ##cer ##os ##.
Is ##n ##' ##t it an ama ##zing thought that every time you wa ##nder into a park or down an avenue or through a leaf ##y street ##, you can see the sh ##adow ##s of these great be ##ast ##s ##?
Pale ##oe ##cology ##, the study of past e ##cos ##ystem ##s ##, crucial to an understanding of our own ##, feels like a portal through which you may pass into an en ##chant ##ed kingdom ##.
And if we really are looking at areas of land of the sort of sizes I ##' ##ve been talking about becoming available ##, why not rein ##tro ##duce some of our lost meg ##afa ##una ##, or at least species closely related to those which have become extinct every ##where ##?
Why should ##n ##' ##t all of us have a Ser ##eng ##eti on our doors ##te ##ps ##?
And perhaps this is the most important thing that re ##wil ##ding offers us ##, the most important thing that ##' ##s missing from our lives ##: hope ##.
In motiv ##ating people to love and defend the natural world ##, an ou ##nce of hope is worth a ton of des ##pair ##.
The story re ##wil ##ding tells us is that e ##cological change need not always pro ##ceed in one direction ##.
It offers us the hope that our silent spring could be replaced by a ra ##uco ##us summer ##.
I am a Ha ##zara ##, and the home ##land of my people is Afghanistan ##.
Like hundreds of thousands of other Ha ##zara kids ##, I was born in exile ##.
The ongoing perse ##cution and operation against the Ha ##zara ##s forced my parents to leave Afghanistan ##.
This perse ##cution has had a long history going back to the late 1800 ##s ##, and the rule of King Abd ##ur Rahman ##.
He killed 63 percent of the Ha ##zara population ##.
He built mina ##rets with their heads ##.
Many Ha ##zara ##s were sold into slavery ##, and many others fled the country for neighboring Iran and Pakistan ##.
My parents also fled to Pakistan ##, and settled in Que ##tta ##, where I was born ##.
After the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers ##, I got a chance to go to Afghanistan for the first time ##, with foreign journalists ##.
I was only 18 ##, and I got a job working as an inter ##pret ##er ##.
After four years ##, I felt it was safe enough to move to Afghanistan permanently ##, and I was working there as a documentary photographer ##, and I worked on many stories ##.
One of the most important stories that I did was the dancing boys of Afghanistan ##.
It is a tra ##gic story about an app ##all ##ing tradition ##.
It involves young kids dancing for war ##lord ##s and powerful men in the society ##.
These boys are often ab ##duct ##ed or bought from their poor parents ##, and they are put to work as sex slaves ##.
This is Shu ##kur ##.
He was ki ##dna ##pped from Kabul by a war ##lord ##.
He was taken to another province ##, where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the war ##lord and his friends ##.
When this story was published in the Washington Post ##, I started receiving death threats ##, and I was forced to leave Afghanistan ##, as my parents were ##.
Along with my family ##, I returned back to Que ##tta ##.
The situation in Que ##tta had changed dramatic ##ally since I left in 2005 ##.
Once a peace ##ful haven for the Ha ##zara ##s ##, it had now turned into the most dangerous city in Pakistan ##.
Ha ##zara ##s are confine ##d into two small areas ##, and they are marginal ##ized social ##ly ##, educational ##ly ##, and financial ##ly ##.
This is Nadir ##.
I had known him since my childhood ##.
He was injured when his van was amb ##ush ##ed by terrorist ##s in Que ##tta ##.
He later died of his injuries ##.
Around 1 ##, ##60 ##0 Ha ##zara members had been killed in various attacks ##, and around 3 ##, ##000 of them were injured ##, and many of them permanently disabled ##.
The attacks on the Ha ##zara community would only get worse ##, so it was not sur ##pris ##ing that many wanted to fl ##ee ##.
After Afghanistan ##, Iran ##, Pakistan ##, Australia is home to the fourth largest population of Ha ##zara ##s in the world ##.
When it came time to leave Pakistan ##, Australia seemed the obvious choice ##.
For much of the past century ##, architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine ##.
" ##F ##or ##m follows function ##" had become moderni ##ty ##' ##s amb ##iti ##ous mani ##festo and det ##rime ##ntal str ##ait ##ja ##cket ##, as it libera ##ted architecture from the decorative ##, but condemned it to ut ##ili ##tarian ri ##gor and rest ##rain ##ed purpose ##.
Of course ##, architecture is about function ##, but I want to remember a re ##writing of this phrase by Bernard T ##sch ##umi ##, and I want to propose a completely different quality ##.
If form follows fiction ##, we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories - ##- stories of the people that live there ##, of the people that work in these buildings ##.
And we could start to ima ##gine the experiences our buildings create ##.
In this sense ##, I ##' ##m interested in fiction not as the im ##pla ##usi ##ble but as the real ##, as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it ##.
Our buildings are prototype ##s ##, ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different ##, and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today ##.
Our buildings are real ##; they ##' ##re being built ##.
They ##' ##re an ex ##plicit engagement in physical reality and concept ##ual possibility ##.
I think of our architecture as organization ##al structures ##.
At their core is indeed structural thinking ##, like a system ##: How can we arra ##nge things in both a functional and ex ##peri ##entia ##l way ##?
How can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives ##?
And how can fi ##ctive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture ##, while the architecture script ##s those stories at the same time ##?
And here comes the second term into play ##, what I call " ##nar ##rati ##ve hybrid ##s ##" - ##- structures of multiple sim ##ult ##ane ##ous stories that un ##fold throughout the buildings we create ##.
So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships ##, both in a programma ##tic and functional way and in an ex ##peri ##entia ##l and em ##oti ##ve or social way ##.
This is the headquarters for China ##' ##s national broadcast ##er ##, which I designed together with Re ##m Ko ##ol ##haa ##s at OM ##A ##.
When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002 ##, the city plan ##ners showed us this image ##: a forest of several hundred sky ##sc ##rap ##ers to emerge in the central business district ##, except at that time ##, only a hand ##ful of them existed ##.
So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about ##, except one thing ##: it would all be about vertical ##ity ##.
Of course ##, the sky ##sc ##rap ##er is vertical - ##- it ##' ##s a prof ##oun ##dly hier ##arch ##ical structure ##, the top always the best ##, the bottom the worst ##, and the taller you are ##, the better ##, so it seems ##.
And we wanted to ask our ##sel ##ves ##, could a building be about a completely different quality ##?
Could it und ##o this hierarchy ##, and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration ##, rather than isolation ##?
So we took this need ##le and ben ##t it back into itself ##, into a loop of inter ##con ##nect ##ed activities ##.
Our idea was to bring all aspects of television ##- ##making into one single structure ##: news ##, program production ##, broadcasting ##, research and training ##, administration - ##- all into a circuit of inter ##con ##nect ##ed activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration ##.
I still very much like this image ##.
It re ##min ##ds one of biology classes ##, if you remember the human body with all its organ ##s and ci ##rc ##ulator ##y systems ##, like at school ##.
And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance ##, but as an organi ##sm ##, as a life form ##.
And as you start to disse ##ct this organi ##sm ##, you can identify a series of primary technical cluster ##s - ##- program production ##, broadcasting center and news ##.
Those are tight ##ly inter ##tw ##ined with social cluster ##s ##: meeting rooms ##, can ##teen ##s ##, chat areas - ##- informal spaces for people to meet and exchange ##.
So the organization ##al structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social ##, the human and the perform ##ative ##.
And of course ##, we used the loop of the building as a ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system ##, to th ##read everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity ##.
With 473 ##, ##000 square meters ##, it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world ##.
It has a population of over 10 ##, ##000 people ##, and of course ##, this is a scale that ex ##ceed ##s the com ##pre ##hen ##sion of many things and the scale of typical architecture ##.
So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut 10 ##, ##000 little stick ##s and g ##lue ##d them onto a model ##, just simply to con ##front our ##sel ##ves with what that quantity actually meant ##.
But of course ##, it ##' ##s not a number ##, it is the people ##, it is a community that in ##hab ##its the building ##, and in order to both com ##pre ##hen ##d this ##, but also script this architecture ##, we identified five characters ##, hy ##pot ##het ##ical characters ##, and we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building ##, thought of where they would meet ##, what they would experience ##.
So it was a way to script and design the building ##, but of course ##, also to commun ##icate its experiences ##.
This was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art in both New York and Beijing ##.
However ##, at the next interval ##, the researchers didn ##' ##t put the cold air on ##, yet the sl ##ime mol ##d slow ##ed down in antic ##ipa ##tion of it happen ##ing ##.
It some ##how knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn ##' ##t like ##.
The conclusion from their experiment was that the sl ##ime mol ##d was able to learn ##.
A third experiment ##: the sl ##ime mol ##d was invited to explore a territory covered in oa ##ts ##.
It fans out in a branch ##ing pattern ##.
As it goes ##, each food node it finds ##, it forms a network ##, a connection to ##, and keeps fora ##ging ##.
After 26 hours ##, it established quite a firm network between the different oa ##ts ##.
Now there ##' ##s nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oa ##t that it started from represents the city of Tokyo ##, and the surrounding oa ##ts are suburban railway stations ##.
The sl ##ime mol ##d had replica ##ted the Tokyo transport network [UNK] [UNK] a complex system developed over time by community d ##welling ##s ##, civil engineering ##, urban planning ##.
What had taken us well over 100 years took the sl ##ime mol ##d just over a day ##.
The conclusion from their experiment was that the sl ##ime mol ##d can form efficient networks and solve the traveling sales ##man problem ##.
It is a biological computer ##.
As such ##, it has been mathematical ##ly model ##ed ##, algorithm ##ically anal ##y ##zed ##.
It ##' ##s been son ##ified ##, replica ##ted ##, sim ##ulated ##.
World over ##, teams of researchers are de ##coding its biological principles to understand its com ##putation ##al rules and apply ##ing that learning to the fields of electronics ##, programming and robot ##ics ##.
So the question is ##, how does this thing work ##?
It doesn ##' ##t have a central ner ##vous system ##.
It doesn ##' ##t have a brain ##, yet it can perform behavior ##s that we associate with brain function ##.
It can learn ##, it can remember ##, it can solve problems ##, it can make decisions ##.
So where does that intelligence lie ##?
So this is a micro ##sco ##py ##, a video I shot ##, and it ##' ##s about 100 times mag ##ni ##fication ##, sp ##ed up about 20 times ##, and inside the sl ##ime mol ##d ##, there is a rhythm ##ic pu ##ls ##ing flow ##, a vei ##n ##- ##like structure carrying cell ##ular material ##, nu ##trie ##nts and chemical information through the cell ##, streaming first in one direction and then back in another ##.
And it is this continuous ##, syn ##ch ##rono ##us os ##cilla ##tion within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment ##, but without any large ##- ##scal ##e control center ##.
This is where its intelligence lies ##.
So it ##' ##s not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organi ##sm ##.
A few years ago ##, I set up S ##li ##M ##o ##C ##o ##, the Slim ##e Mo ##uld Collective ##.
It ##' ##s an online ##, open ##, democratic network for sl ##ime mol ##d researchers and ent ##hus ##ias ##ts to share knowledge and experiment ##ation across disciplina ##ry divide ##s and across academic divide ##s ##.
The Slim ##e Mo ##uld Collective membership is self ##- ##sele ##cting ##.
People have found the collective as the sl ##ime mol ##d finds the oa ##ts ##.
And it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and researchers but also artists like me ##, architects ##, designers ##, writers ##, activists ##, you name it ##.
It ##' ##s a very interesting ##, e ##cle ##ctic membership ##.
Just a few examples ##: an artist who paint ##s with fl ##uo ##res ##cent Phys ##arum ##; a coll ##aborative team who are com ##bining biological and electronic design with 3D printing technologies in a workshop ##; another artist who is using the sl ##ime mol ##d as a way of eng ##aging a community to map their area ##.
Here ##, the sl ##ime mol ##d is being used directly as a biological tool ##, but meta ##ph ##ori ##cally as a symbol for ways of talking about social co ##hes ##ion ##, communication and cooperation ##.
Other public engagement activities ##, I run lots of sl ##ime mol ##d workshops ##, a creative way of eng ##aging with the organi ##sm ##.
So people are invited to come and learn about what ama ##zing things it can do ##, and they design their own pet ##ri dis ##h experiment ##, an environment for the sl ##ime mol ##d to navi ##gate so they can test its properties ##.
Everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the Slim ##e Mo ##uld Collective ##.
There ##' ##s something about caves - ##- a sh ##adow ##y opening in a limestone c ##liff that draws you in ##.
As you pass through the portal between light and dark ##, you enter a sub ##terra ##nea ##n world - ##- a place of per ##pet ##ual g ##lo ##om ##, of earth ##y sm ##ell ##s ##, of hus ##hed silence ##.
Long ago in Europe ##, ancient people also entered these underground world ##s ##.
As witness to their passage ##, they left behind mysterious eng ##ra ##vings and paintings ##, like this panel of humans ##, triangle ##s and zi ##g ##zag ##s from O ##jo G ##uar ##eña in Spain ##.
You now walk the same path as these early artists ##.
And in this sur ##real ##, other ##world ##ly place ##, it ##' ##s almost possible to ima ##gine that you hear the mu ##ffle ##d foot ##fall of skin boot ##s on soft earth ##, or that you see the fl ##ick ##ering of a to ##rch around the next ben ##d ##.
When I ##' ##m in a cave ##, I often find my ##self won ##dering what drove these people to go so deep to bra ##ve dangerous and narrow passage ##ways to leave their mark ##?
In this video clip ##, that was shot half a kilometer ##, or about a third of a mile ##, underground ##, in the cave of Cu ##don in Spain ##, we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously une ##x ##plo ##red section of the cave ##.
As we c ##ra ##wl ##ed forward ##, military ##- ##style ##, with the ceiling getting ever lower ##, we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photographer ##, Dylan ##, could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DS ##L ##R camera ##.
So while he filmed me ##, I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a point ##- ##and ##- ##sh ##oot camera that we kept for that type of occasion ##.
Half a kilometer underground ##.
Seri ##ously ##.
What was some ##body doing down there with a to ##rch or a stone la ##mp ##?
I mean - ##- me ##, it makes sense ##, right ##?
But you know ##, this is the kind of question that I ##' ##m trying to answer with my research ##.
I study some of the oldest art in the world ##.
It was created by these early artists in Europe ##, between 10 ##, ##000 and 40 ##, ##000 years ago ##.
And the thing is that I ##' ##m not just studying it because it ##' ##s beautiful ##, though some of it certainly is ##.
But what I ##' ##m interested in is the development of the modern mind ##, of the evolution of creat ##ivity ##, of ima ##gination ##, of abstract thought ##, about what it means to be human ##.
While all species commun ##icate in one way or another ##, only we humans have really taken it to another level ##.
Our desire and ability to share and coll ##abo ##rate has been a huge part of our success story ##.
Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange made possible ##, in large part ##, by our ability to commun ##icate - ##- in particular ##, using graphic or written forms of communication ##.
The thing is ##, though ##, that we ##' ##ve been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it ##' ##s easy to for ##get that certain abilities haven ##' ##t already existed ##.
It ##' ##s one of the things I find most fa ##sci ##nating about studying our deep history ##.
Those people didn ##' ##t have the shoulder ##s of any giant ##s to stand on ##.
They were the original shoulder ##s ##.
And while a sur ##pris ##ing number of important invention ##s come out of that distant time ##, what I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication ##.
There are three main types of communication ##, spoken ##, ge ##stu ##ral - ##- so things like sign language - ##- and graphic communication ##.
Sp ##oken and ge ##stu ##ral are by their very nature ep ##heme ##ral ##.
The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist ##, as an Iranian woman artist ##, as an Iranian woman artist living in exile ##.
Well ##, it has its pluse ##s and minus ##es ##.
On the dark side ##, politics doesn ##' ##t seem to escape people like me ##.
Every Iranian artist ##, in one form or another ##, is political ##.
Politics have defined our lives ##.
If you ##' ##re living in Iran ##, you ##' ##re facing censo ##rship ##, har ##ass ##ment ##, arrest ##, torture - ##- at times ##, execution ##.
If you ##' ##re living outside like me ##, you ##' ##re faced with life in exile - ##- the pain of the long ##ing and the separation from your loved ones and your family ##.
Therefore ##, we don ##' ##t find the moral ##, emotional ##, psychological and political space to distance our ##sel ##ves from the reality of social responsibility ##.
Odd ##ly enough ##, an artist such as my ##self finds herself also in the position of being the voice ##, the speaker of my people ##, even if I have ##, indeed ##, no access to my own country ##.
Also ##, people like my ##self ##, we ##' ##re fighting two battles on different grounds ##.
We ##' ##re being critical of the West ##, the perception of the West about our identity - ##- about the image that is constructed about us ##, about our women ##, about our politics ##, about our religion ##.
We are there to take pride and ins ##ist on respect ##.
And at the same time ##, we ##' ##re fighting another battle ##.
That is our regime ##, our government - ##- our at ##roc ##ious government ##, [ ##tha ##t ##] has done every crime in order to stay in power ##.
Our artists are at risk ##.
We are in a position of danger ##.
We pose a threat to the order of the government ##.
But iron ##ically ##, this situation has em ##power ##ed all of us ##, because we are considered ##, as artists ##, central to the cultural ##, political ##, social discours ##e in Iran ##.
We are there to inspire ##, to pro ##vo ##ke ##, to mobil ##ize ##, to bring hope to our people ##.
We are the reporter ##s of our people ##, and are commun ##icato ##rs to the outside world ##.
Art is our weapon ##.
Culture is a form of resistance ##.
I en ##vy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression ##.
For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics ##.
From the fact that they are only serving one audience ##, mainly the Western culture ##.
But also ##, I wo ##rry about the West ##, because often in this country ##, in this Western world that we have ##, culture risks being a form of entertainment ##.
Our people de ##pend on our artists ##, and culture is beyond communication ##.
My journey as an artist started from a very ##, very personal place ##.
I did not start to make social commentary about my country ##.
The Nazis in ##vaded the Netherlands ##.
Their gr ##im plans were evident ##.
They meant to rule by means of rep ##ression ##.
Diploma ##cy had failed to stop the Germans ##.
Only br ##ute force remained ##.
It was our last resort ##.
My father was there to provide it ##.
As the son of a farmer who knew how to hun ##t ##, my father was an excellent marks ##man ##.
When he aimed ##, he never missed ##.
At this de ##cisive moment in Dutch history my father was position ##ed on the bank of the river W ##aal near the city of Nijmegen ##.
He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to o ##ccupy a free country ##, his country ##, our country ##.
He fired ##. Nothing happened ##.
He fired again ##.
No German soldier fell to the ground ##.
My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite river ##bank ##.
Hitler ##' ##s troops marche ##d on ##, and there was nothing my father could do about it ##.
Until the day my father died ##, he was fr ##ust ##rated about missing these shots ##.
He could have done something ##.
But with an old gun ##, not even the best marks ##man in the armed forces could have hit the mark ##.
So this story stayed with me ##.
Then in high school ##, I was gr ##ip ##ped by the stories of the Allied soldiers - ##- soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risk ##ed their lives to libera ##te a country and a people that they didn ##' ##t know ##.
They libera ##ted my birth town ##.
It was then that I decided I would take up the gun - ##- out of respect and gra ##titude for those men and women who came to libera ##te us ##.
From the awareness that sometimes only the gun can stand between good and evil ##.
And that is why I took up the gun - ##- not to shoot ##, not to kill ##, not to destroy ##, but to stop those who would do evil ##, to protect the vulnerable ##, to defend democratic values ##, to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place ##.
Ladies and gent ##lemen ##, I do not stand here today to tell you about the g ##lory of weapons ##.
I do not like guns ##.
And once you have been under fire your ##self ##, it brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to bra ##g about ##.
I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability ##.
The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world ##.
Now this may sound contra ##dic ##tory to you ##.
But not only have I seen with my own eyes during my deployment ##s in Lebanon ##, Sarajevo and as the Netherlands ##' Chief of Defence ##, this is also supported by cold ##, hard statistics ##.
Violence has declined dramatic ##ally over the last 500 years ##.
Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news ##, wars between developed countries are no longer common ##place ##.
The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages ##.
And occur ##rence ##s of civil war and rep ##ression have declined since the end of the Cold War ##.
Statistics show that we are living in a relatively peace ##ful era ##.
Why ##?
Why has violence decreased ##?
Has the human mind changed ##?
Well ##, we were talking about the human mind this morning ##.
Did we simply lose our be ##ast ##ly im ##pulse ##s for revenge ##, for violent ritual ##s ##, for pure ra ##ge ##?
Or is there something else ##?
What is a coral and where does it come from ##?
Coral ##s are born in a number of different ways ##, but most often by mass sp ##awn ##ing ##: all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year ##, releasing all the eggs they ##' ##ve made that year into the water column ##, package ##d into bun ##dles with sp ##erm cells ##.
And those bun ##dles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart ##.
And hope ##fully - ##- hope ##fully - ##- at the surface of the ocean ##, they meet the eggs and sp ##erm from other coral ##s ##.
And that is why you need lots of coral ##s on a coral re ##ef - ##- so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface ##.
When they ##' ##re fer ##tili ##zed ##, they do what any other animal egg does ##: divide ##s in half again and again and again ##.
Taking these photos under the micro ##scope every year is one of my favorite and most magic ##al moments of the year ##.
At the end of all this cell division ##, they turn into a swimming larva - ##- a little tin ##y bl ##ob of fat the size of a pop ##py seed ##, but with all of the sensor ##y systems that we have ##.
They can sense color and light ##, text ##ures ##, chemical ##s ##, pH ##.
They can even feel pressure waves ##; they can hear sound ##.
And they use those talents to search the bottom of the re ##ef for a place to att ##ach and live the rest of their lives ##.
So ima ##gine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life They att ##ach in the place they find most suitable ##, they build a sk ##elet ##on under ##nea ##th themselves ##, they build a mouth and tenta ##cles ##, and then they begin the difficult work of building the world ##' ##s coral re ##ef ##s ##.
One coral pol ##y ##p will divide itself again and again and again ##, leaving a limestone sk ##elet ##on under ##nea ##th itself and growing up toward the sun ##.
Given hundreds of years and many species ##, what you get is a massive limestone structure that can be seen from space in many cases ##, covered by a thin skin of these hard ##work ##ing animals ##.
Now ##, there are only a few hundred species of coral ##s on the planet ##, may ##be 1 ##, ##000 ##.
But these systems house millions and millions of other species ##, and that diversity is what stabil ##izes the systems ##, and it ##' ##s where we ##' ##re finding our new medicine ##s ##.
It ##' ##s how we find new sources of food ##.
I ##' ##m lu ##cky enough to work on the island of Cu ##ra ##çao ##, where we still have re ##ef ##s that look like this ##.
But ##, indeed ##, much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this ##.
Scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world ##' ##s coral re ##ef ##s ##, and they have documented with increasing certain ##ty the causes ##.
But in my research ##, I ##' ##m not interested in looking back ##ward ##.
My colleagues and I in Cu ##ra ##çao are interested in looking forward at what might be ##.
And we have the tin ##iest reason to be op ##timi ##stic ##.
Because even in some of these re ##ef ##s that we probably could have written off long ago ##, we sometimes see baby coral ##s arrive and survive any ##way ##.
And we ##' ##re starting to think that baby coral ##s may have the ability to ad ##just to some of the conditions that the adults couldn ##' ##t ##.
They may be able to ad ##just ever so slightly more read ##ily to this human planet ##.
So in the research I do with my colleagues in Cu ##ra ##çao ##, we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage ##, what it ##' ##s looking for and how we can try to help it through that process ##.
I ##' ##m going to show you three examples of the work we ##' ##ve done to try to answer those questions ##.
A few years ago we took a 3D print ##er and we made coral choice survey ##s - ##- different colors and different text ##ures ##, and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle ##.
And we found that coral ##s ##, even without the biology involved ##, still pre ##fer white and pink ##, the colors of a healthy re ##ef ##.
And they pre ##fer c ##re ##vice ##s and gr ##oo ##ves and holes ##, where they will be safe from being tram ##ple ##d or eat ##en by a predator ##.
So we can use this knowledge ##, we can go back and say we need to restore those factors - ##- that pink ##, that white ##, those c ##re ##vice ##s ##, those hard surfaces - ##- in our conservation projects ##.
We can also use that knowledge if we ##' ##re going to put something under ##water ##, like a sea wall or a pie ##r ##.
We can choose to use the materials and colors and text ##ures that might bias the system back toward those coral ##s ##.
Now in addition to the surfaces ##, we also study the chemical and micro ##bia ##l signals that attract coral ##s to re ##ef ##s ##.
Starting about six years ago ##, I began cult ##uring bacteria from surfaces where coral ##s had settled ##.
And I tried those one by one by one ##, looking for the bacteria that would convince coral ##s to settle and att ##ach ##.
And we now have many bacteria ##l strain ##s in our free ##zer that will re ##lia ##bly cause coral ##s to go through that settlement and att ##achment process ##.
So as we speak ##, my colleagues in Cu ##ra ##çao are testing those bacteria to see if they ##' ##ll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab ##, and to see if those coral settlers will survive better when we put them back under ##water ##.
This is a river ##.
This is a stream ##.
This is a river ##.
This is happen ##ing all over the country ##.
There are ten ##s of thousands of miles of dewa ##tere ##d streams in the United States ##.
On this map ##, the colored areas represent water conflicts ##.
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well ##.
The reasons vary state to state ##, but mostly in the details ##.
There are 4 ##, ##000 miles of dewa ##tere ##d streams in Montana alone ##.
They would ord ##inar ##ily support fish and other wildlife ##.
They ##' ##re the vei ##ns of the e ##cos ##ystem ##, and they ##' ##re often empty vei ##ns ##.
I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it ##' ##s an arch ##ety ##pe for the larger story ##.
This is Pri ##ck ##ly Pe ##ar Creek ##.
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena ##.
It supports wild fish including cut ##th ##roat ##, brown and rain ##bow tro ##ut ##.
Near ##ly every year for more than a hundred years ##, it ##' ##s looked like this in the summer ##.
How did we get here ##?
Well ##, it started back in the late 1800 ##s when people started sett ##ling in places like Montana ##.
In short ##, there was a lot of water and there were ##n ##' ##t very many people ##.
But as more people showed up want ##ing water ##, the folk ##s who were there first got a little concerned ##, and in 1865 ##, Montana passed its first water law ##.
It basic ##ally said ##, every ##body near the stream can share in the stream ##.
Odd ##ly ##, a lot of people showed up want ##ing to share the stream ##, and the folk ##s who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyer ##s ##.
There were pre ##cedent ##- ##sett ##ing suit ##s in 1870 and 1872 ##, both involving Pri ##ck ##ly Pe ##ar Creek ##.
And in 1921 ##, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Pri ##ck ##ly Pe ##ar that the folk ##s who were there first had the first ##, or " ##sen ##ior water rights ##. ##"
These senior water rights are key ##.
The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this ##.
Some of these creek ##s have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream ##.
Similarly ##, there ##' ##s been ex ##plosive growth in India ##, for example ##, where rural farmers are using exchange ##s - ##- growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year ##.
This is powered by low ##- ##cos ##t VS ##AT technology ##, aggressive ##ly trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market ##.
China ##' ##s Dal ##ian Com ##mo ##dity Exchange ##, three years ago ##, 2004 ##, over ##took the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest com ##mo ##dity exchange in the world ##.
Now ##, in Ethiopia ##, we ##' ##re in the process of design ##ing the first organized Ethiopia Com ##mo ##dity Exchange ##.
We ##' ##re not trying to cut and past ##e the Chicago model or the India model ##, but creating a system unique ##ly tail ##ored to Ethiopia ##' ##s needs and real ##ities ##, Ethiopia ##' ##s small farmers ##.
So ##, the EC ##X is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia ##.
We ##' ##re creating a system that serves all market actors ##, that creates inte ##gri ##ty ##, trust ##, efficiency ##, trans ##pare ##ncy and enable ##s small farmers to manage the risks that I have described ##.
In the design of our com ##mo ##dity exchange in Ethiopia ##, we ##' ##ve done something rather unique ##, which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective ##, or what we call the EC ##X Edge ##.
The EC ##X Edge pretty much creates the entire e ##cos ##ystem in which the market will develop itself ##.
And this is because one of the things we ##' ##ve learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piece ##mea ##l approach does not work ##.
You ##' ##ve got one dono ##r trying to develop market information ##, another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards ##, another IC ##T ##, and yet another on ware ##hou ##sing ##, or ware ##house re ##cei ##pts ##.
In our approach in Ethiopia ##, we ##' ##ve decided to put together the entire e ##cos ##ystem ##, or environment ##, in which trade takes place ##.
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system ##, which will initially start as an open out ##c ##ry ##, because we don ##' ##t think the country ##' ##s ready for full electronic trading ##.
But at the same time ##, we ##' ##ll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done ##, which is itself to operate something like an Internet ca ##fe in the rural areas ##.
So that farmers and small trade ##rs can actually come to a terminal center - ##- what we call the remote access terminal centers - ##- and actually ##, without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dia ##l up or any of those things ##, simply see the trading that ##' ##s happen ##ing on the Addis Ab ##aba trading floor ##.
At the same time ##, what ##' ##s very fundamental to this market is that - ##- and again ##, an innovation that we ##' ##ve designed for our exchange - ##- is that the exchange will operate ware ##houses around the country ##, in which grade certification and ware ##house re ##cei ##pti ##ng will be done ##.
And in turn ##, we ##' ##ll operate an in ##- ##house clear ##ing system ##, to assure that payment is done appropriate ##ly ##, in the right amount and at the right time ##, so that basic ##ally ##, we create trust and inte ##gri ##ty in the system ##.
Ob ##vio ##usly ##, we work with exchange actors ##, and as we ##' ##re developing the exchange market itself ##, we ##' ##re also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework ##, the over ##arch ##ing legal framework for making this market work ##.
So ##, in fact ##, our pro ##clamation is going to parliament next month ##.
What ##' ##s really important is that the EC ##X will operate a market information system to disse ##minat ##e prices in real time to farmers around the country ##, using VS ##AT technology to bring an electronic price disse ##mination directly to farmers ##.
What this does is transform ##s ##, fundamental ##ly ##, the farmers ##' relationship to the market ##.
Where ##as before the farmer used to think local - ##- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market ##, eight to 10 kilometers away on average ##, and sell whatever they happened to have ##, without any idea of what the price premiu ##m or anything else was - ##- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market ##.
And they start to think national ##, and even global ##.
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions ##, but also plant ##ing decisions ##, on the basis of information coming from the future ##s price market ##.
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premiu ##m ##.
So all of this will transform farmers ##.
It will also transform the way trade ##rs do business ##.
It will stop them from doing simple ##, back ##- ##to ##- ##back ##, limited ar ##bit ##rage to really thinking strategic ##ally about how to move grain across long distances from [ ##sur ##plus regions ##] to [ ##de ##ficit areas ##] ##.
Can Ethiopia do this ##?
It seems very amb ##iti ##ous ##.
But it will create new opportunities ##.
We believe that this initiative requires great political will ##, and we ##' ##ll have to align the financial sector ##, as well as the IC ##T sector ##, and really even the underlying legal framework ##.
We believe that the winds of change are here ##, and that we can do it ##.
EC ##X is the market for Ethiopia ##' ##s new mille ##nni ##um ##, which starts in about eight months ##.
The last parliament of our century opened with our president anno ##un ##cing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today ##.
We believe that the stake ##s are high ##, but that the returns will be even greater ##.
EC ##X ##, more ##over ##, can become a trading platform for a pan ##- ##A ##frica ##n market in agricultural com ##mo ##diti ##es ##.
Ethiopia ##' ##s domestic market is about one billion dollars of value ##.
And we feel that over the next five years ##, if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent ##, just 40 percent ##, of the domestic market ##, and add just 25 percent value to that market ##, the value of the market doubles ##.
Ethiopia ##' ##s agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa ##' ##s grain production ##, and ##, in fact ##, Ethiopia is the second largest mai ##ze producer in Africa ##.
So the potential is there ##.
The will is there ##.
The commitment is there ##.
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers ##' choice ##s ##, to grow our agriculture ##, and to change Africa ##.
So ##, we are in the business of finding our ha ##ppi ##ness ##.
When I was a ki ##d ##, the disaster we wo ##rri ##ed about most was a nuclear war ##.
That ##' ##s why we had a barrel like this down in our basement ##, filled with can ##s of food and water ##.
When the nuclear attack came ##, we were supposed to go down ##stair ##s ##, hun ##ker down ##, and eat out of that barrel ##.
Today the greatest risk of global cat ##ast ##rophe doesn ##' ##t look like this ##.
Instead ##, it looks like this ##.
If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades ##, it ##' ##s most likely to be a highly in ##fect ##ious virus rather than a war ##.
Not missiles ##, but micro ##bes ##.
Now ##, part of the reason for this is that we ##' ##ve in ##vested a huge amount in nuclear det ##erre ##nts ##.
But we ##' ##ve actually in ##vested very little in a system to stop an epi ##demi ##c ##.
We ##' ##re not ready for the next epi ##demi ##c ##.
Let ##' ##s look at E ##bola ##.
I ##' ##m sure all of you read about it in the newspaper ##, lots of tou ##gh challenges ##.
I followed it care ##fully through the case analysis tools we use to track poli ##o era ##dication ##.
And as you look at what went on ##, the problem wasn ##' ##t that there was a system that didn ##' ##t work well enough ##, the problem was that we didn ##' ##t have a system at all ##.
In fact ##, there ##' ##s some pretty obvious key missing pieces ##.
We didn ##' ##t have a group of epi ##demi ##ologists ready to go ##, who would have gone ##, seen what the disease was ##, seen how far it had spread ##.
The case reports came in on paper ##.
It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely ina ##cc ##urat ##e ##.
We didn ##' ##t have a medical team ready to go ##.
We didn ##' ##t have a way of preparing people ##.
Now ##, M ##éd ##eci ##ns Sans Front ##ières did a great job orchestra ##ting volunteers ##.
But even so ##, we were far slow ##er than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries ##.
And a large epi ##demi ##c would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers ##.
There was no one there to look at treatment approaches ##.
No one to look at the diagnostic ##s ##.
No one to figure out what tools should be used ##.
As an example ##, we could have taken the blood of survivors ##, process ##ed it ##, and put that plasma back in people to protect them ##.
But that was never tried ##.
So there was a lot that was missing ##.
And these things are really a global failure ##.
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries ##.
But where are they situated ##?
I will s ##wa ##p the bu ##bble ##s to a map ##.
Look ##, the highly in ##fected are four percent of all population and they hold 50 percent of the HIV ##- ##in ##fected ##.
HIV exists all over the world ##.
Look ##, you have bu ##bble ##s all over the world here ##.
Brazil has many HIV ##- ##in ##fected ##.
Arab countries not so much ##, but Iran is quite high ##.
They have hero ##in add ##ict ##ion and also pro ##stitution in Iran ##.
India has many because they are many ##.
Southeast Asia ##, and so on ##.
But ##, there is one part of Africa - ##- and the difficult thing is ##, at the same time ##, not to make a uniform statement about Africa ##, not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this ##, on one hand ##.
On the other hand ##, try to say that this is not the case ##, because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now ##.
UN ##A ##ID ##S have done good data available ##, finally ##, about the spread of HIV ##.
It could be con ##cu ##rren ##cy ##.
It could be some virus types ##.
It could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency ##.
After all ##, if you are completely healthy and you have heter ##ose ##xu ##al sex ##, the risk of infection in one inter ##course is one in 1 ##, ##000 ##.
Don ##' ##t jump to conclusion ##s now on how to be ##hav ##e ton ##ight and so on ##.
But - ##- and if you are in an un ##fa ##vora ##ble situation ##, more sexual ##ly trans ##mitted diseases ##, it can be one in 100 ##.
But what we think is that it could be con ##cu ##rren ##cy ##.
And what is con ##cu ##rren ##cy ##?
In Sweden ##, we have no con ##cu ##rren ##cy ##.
We have serial mono ##gam ##y ##.
Vo ##dka ##, New Year ##' ##s Eve - ##- new partner for the spring ##.
Vo ##dka ##, Mid ##sum ##mer ##' ##s Eve - ##- new partner for the fall ##.
Vo ##dka - ##- and it goes on like this ##, you know ##?
And you collect a big number of ex ##es ##.
And we have a terrible ch ##lam ##ydi ##a epi ##demi ##c - ##- terrible ch ##lam ##ydi ##a epi ##demi ##c which stick ##s around for many years ##.
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection and therefore ##, having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others ##.
Pro ##bab ##ly ##, it ##' ##s a combination of this ##.
And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this ##.
You can get this chart ##, free ##.
We have up ##loaded UN ##A ##ID ##S data on the Gap ##min ##der site ##.
And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart ##, we will not only have the money ##, but we will also use the brain ##.
Then ##, even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomi ##cal number - ##- 10 to the power of 32 ##.
So if you take into account future generations as much as our own ##, every other moral im ##pera ##tive of phi ##lant ##hro ##pic cost just becomes ir ##rel ##evan ##t ##.
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existent ##ial risk because even the tin ##iest decrease in existent ##ial risk would just over ##w ##hel ##m any other benefit you could hope to achieve ##.
And even if you just look at the current people ##, and ig ##nore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct ##, it should still have a high priority ##.
Now ##, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem ##, because it ##' ##s more sub ##tle and perhaps difficult to gras ##p ##.
Think about some time in your life - ##- some people might never have experienced it - ##- but some people ##, there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fant ##astic ##.
It might have been at the moment of some great ##, creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage ##.
Or when you understood something you had never done before ##.
Or perhaps in the e ##cs ##tas ##y of romantic love ##.
Or an ae ##sthetic experience - ##- a sun ##set or a great piece of art ##.
Every once in a while we have these moments ##, and we real ##ize just how good life can be when it ##' ##s at its best ##.
And you won ##der ##, why can ##' ##t it be like that all the time ##?
You just want to c ##ling onto this ##.
And then ##, of course ##, it drift ##s back into ordinary life and the memory fa ##des ##.
And it ##' ##s really difficult to reca ##ll ##, in a normal frame of mind ##, just how good life can be at its best ##.
Or how bad it can be at its worst ##.
The third big problem is that life isn ##' ##t usually as won ##der ##ful as it could be ##.
I think that ##' ##s a big ##, big problem ##.
It ##' ##s easy to say what we don ##' ##t want ##.
Here are a number of things that we don ##' ##t want - ##- illness ##, in ##vol ##untary death ##, un ##nec ##essa ##ry suffering ##, cruel ##ty ##, st ##unted growth ##, memory loss ##, ig ##nor ##ance ##, absence of creat ##ivity ##.
Su ##ppo ##se we fixed these things - ##- we did something about all of these ##.
We were very successful ##.
We got ri ##d of all of these things ##.
We might end up with something like this ##, which is - ##- I mean ##, it ##' ##s a he ##ck of a lot better than that ##.
But is this really the best we can dream of ##?
Is this the best we can do ##?
Or is it possible to find something a little bit more ins ##pir ##ing to work towards ##?
And if we think about this ##, I think it ##' ##s very clear that there are ways in which we could change things ##, not just by eli ##minat ##ing negative ##s ##, but adding positive ##s ##.
On my wish list ##, at least ##, would be ##: much longer ##, health ##ier lives ##, greater subject ##ive well ##- ##bei ##ng ##, enhanced cognitive capa ##citi ##es ##, more knowledge and understanding ##, un ##limi ##ted opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits ##, better relationships ##, an un ##bound ##ed potential for spiritual ##, moral and intellectual development ##.
If we want to achieve this ##, what ##, in the world ##, would have to change ##?
And this is the answer - ##- we would have to change ##.
Not just the world around us ##, but we ##, our ##sel ##ves ##.
Not just the way we think about the world ##, but the way we are - ##- our very biology ##.
Human nature would have to change ##.
Now ##, when we think about changing human nature ##, the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies - ##- growth hormone therapy ##, cos ##meti ##c surgery ##, st ##imu ##lant ##s like Rita ##lin ##, Ad ##deral ##l ##, anti ##- ##de ##pressa ##nts ##, ana ##bolic ster ##oid ##s ##, artificial heart ##s ##.
It ##' ##s a pretty path ##eti ##c list ##.
They do great things for a few people who su ##ffer from some specific condition ##, but for most people ##, they don ##' ##t really transform what it is to be human ##.
And they also all seem a little bit - ##- most people have this ins ##tin ##ct that ##, well ##, sure ##, there needs to be anti ##- ##de ##pressa ##nts for the really de ##pressed people ##.
But there ##' ##s a kind of que ##asi ##ness that these are un ##natural in some way ##.
It ##' ##s worth reca ##lling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and en ##hance ##ment technologies that we use ##.
We have skin en ##hance ##ments ##, clothing ##.
As far as I can see ##, all of you are users of this en ##hance ##ment technology in this room ##, so that ##' ##s a great thing ##.
Mo ##od modi ##fier ##s have been used from time im ##mem ##orial - ##- ca ##ffe ##ine ##, alcohol ##, nic ##oti ##ne ##, immune system en ##hance ##ment ##, vision en ##hance ##ment ##, ane ##sthetic ##s - ##- we take that very much for granted ##, but just think about how great progress that is - ##- like ##, having an operation before ane ##sthetic ##s was not fun ##.
Contra ##cept ##ives ##, cos ##meti ##cs and brain rep ##rog ##ramm ##ing techniques - ##- that sounds om ##inou ##s ##, but the distinction between what is a technology - ##- a ga ##dge ##t would be the arch ##ety ##pe - ##- and other ways of changing and re ##writing human nature is quite sub ##tle ##.
So if you think about what it means to learn ari ##th ##meti ##c or to learn to read ##, you ##' ##re actually ##, literally re ##writing your own brain ##.
You ##' ##re changing the micro ##stru ##cture of your brain as you go along ##.
So in a broad sense ##, we don ##' ##t need to think about technology as only little ga ##dge ##ts ##, like these things here ##, but even institutions and techniques ##, psychological methods and so forth ##.
Form ##s of organization can have a prof ##oun ##d impact on human nature ##.
Looking ahead ##, there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed soon ##er or later ##.
Today I want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war ##.
These are not normally the most che ##er ##ful of topics ##, nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about ##.
Yet ##, not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago ##, but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they in ##f ##lic ##t ##.
Three things stand out ##: leadership ##, diploma ##cy and institution ##al design ##.
What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter ##, how they matter ##, and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways ##, that is ##, how all of us can contribute to developing and hon ##ing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last ##.
But let ##' ##s start at the beginning ##.
Civil wars have made news head ##lines for many decades now ##, and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat ##.
For nearly two decades now ##, the news has been bad and the images have been hau ##nting ##.
In Georgia ##, after years of stal ##ema ##te ##, we saw a full ##- ##scal ##e res ##urg ##ence of violence in August ##, 2008 ##.
This quickly escala ##ted into a five ##- ##day war between Russia and Georgia ##, leaving Georgia ever more divided ##.
In Kenya ##, contested presidential elections in 2007 - ##- we just heard about them - ##- quickly led to high levels of inter ##- ##eth ##nic violence and the killing and dis ##placement of thousands of people ##.
In Sri Lanka ##, a decades ##- ##long civil war between the Tamil minority and the Sinh ##ala majority led to a blood ##y clima ##x in 2009 ##, after perhaps as many as 100 ##, ##000 people had been killed since 1983 ##.
In Ky ##rg ##y ##zs ##tan ##, just over the last few weeks ##, un ##pre ##cedent ##ed levels of violence occurred between ethnic Ky ##rg ##y ##z and ethnic Uz ##bek ##s ##.
Hundred ##s have been killed ##, and more than 100 ##, ##000 dis ##placed ##, including many ethnic Uz ##bek ##s who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan ##.
In the Middle East ##, conflict between Israeli ##s and Palestinian ##s continues una ##bate ##d ##, and it becomes ever more difficult to see how ##, just how a possible ##, sustainable solution can be achieved ##.
Dar ##fur may have sl ##ip ##ped from the news head ##lines ##, but the killing and dis ##placement there continues as well ##, and the she ##er human mise ##ry that it creates is very hard to fat ##hom ##.
And in Iraq ##, finally ##, violence is on the rise again ##, and the country has yet to form a government four months after its last parliamentary elections ##.
But hang on ##, this talk is to be about the good news ##.
So are these now the images of the past ##?
Well ##, not ##wit ##hs ##tand ##ing the g ##lo ##omy pictures from the Middle East ##, Dar ##fur ##, Iraq ##, elsewhere ##, there is a longer ##- ##ter ##m trend that does represent some good news ##.
Over the past two decades ##, since the end of the Cold War ##, there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars ##.
Since the high in the early 1990s ##, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing ##, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today ##.
The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two ##.
But this trend is less una ##mbi ##guo ##us ##.
The highest level of deaths on the battle ##field was recorded between 1998 and 2001 ##, with about 80 ##, ##000 soldiers ##, police ##men and rebels killed every year ##.
The lowest number of combat ##ant casualties occurred in 2003 ##, with just 20 ##, ##000 killed ##.
Despite the up and down since then ##, the overall trend - ##- and this is the important bit - ##- clearly points down ##ward for the past two decades ##.
The news about civilian casualties is also less bad than it used to be ##.
From over 12 ##, ##000 civilians del ##ibe ##rate ##ly killed in civil wars in 1997 and 1998 ##, a decade later ##, this figure stands at 4 ##, ##000 ##.
This is a decrease by two ##- ##thi ##rds ##.
This decline would be even more obvious if we factor ##ed in the gen ##ocide in Rwanda in 1994 ##.
But then 800 ##, ##000 civilians were sl ##au ##ghter ##ed in a matter of just a few months ##.
This certainly is an ac ##com ##pli ##shment that must never be sur ##passed ##.
What is also important is to note that these figures only tell part of the story ##.
They ex ##clu ##de people that died as a consequence of civil war ##, from hung ##er or disease ##, for example ##.
There is ##, for example ##, a project that ##' ##s under ##way to sequence a thousand individuals - ##- their genome ##s - ##- from different parts of the world ##.
They ##' ##ve sequence ##d 185 African ##s from two populations in Africa ##.
[ ##T ##he ##y ##' ##ve ##] sequence ##d approximately equally [ ##as ##] many people in Europe and in China ##.
And we can begin to say how much varia ##nce do we find ##, how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences ##.
And it ##' ##s a lot ##: 38 million variable positions ##.
But we can then ask ##: Are there any absolute differences between African ##s and non ##- ##A ##frica ##ns ##?
Per ##ha ##ps the biggest difference most of us would ima ##gine existed ##.
And with absolute difference - ##- and I mean a difference where people inside Africa at a certain position ##, where all individuals - ##- 100 percent - ##- have one letter ##, and every ##body outside Africa has another letter ##.
And the answer to that ##, among those millions of differences ##, is that there is not a single such position ##.
This may be sur ##pris ##ing ##.
Maybe a single individual is mis ##cla ##ssi ##fied or so ##.
So we can re ##lax the c ##rite ##rion a bit and say ##: How many positions do we find where 95 percent of people in Africa have one variant ##, 95 percent another variant ##, and the number of that is 12 ##.
So this is very sur ##pris ##ing ##.
It means that when we look at people and see a person from Africa and a person from Europe or Asia ##, we cannot ##, for a single position in the genome with 100 percent accuracy ##, pred ##ict what the person would carry ##.
And only for 12 positions can we hope to be 95 percent right ##.
This may be sur ##pris ##ing ##, because we can ##, of course ##, look at these people and quite easily say where they or their an ##cestors came from ##.
So what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so read ##ily see - ##- fac ##ial features ##, skin color ##, hair structure - ##- are not determined by single genes with big effects ##, but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world ##.
There is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that I think is worth ##while to consider ##, and that is that ##, in a very literal sense ##, they ##' ##re really on the surface of our bodies ##.
They are what we just said - ##- fac ##ial features ##, hair structure ##, skin color ##.
There are also a number of features that vary between continent ##s like that that have to do with how we meta ##bol ##ize food that we ing ##est ##, or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with micro ##bes that try to in ##vade our bodies ##.
But so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly intera ##ct with our environment ##, in a direct con ##frontation ##, if you like ##.
It ##' ##s easy to ima ##gine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted fr ##e ##quen ##cies of genes that are involved in them ##.
But if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don ##' ##t directly intera ##ct with the environment - ##- our ki ##dne ##ys ##, our liver ##s ##, our heart ##s - ##- by just looking at these organ ##s ##, where in the world they would come from ##.
So there ##' ##s another interesting thing that comes from this realizat ##ion that humans have a recent common origin in Africa ##, and that is that when those humans emerged around 100 ##, ##000 years ago or so ##, they were not alone on the planet ##.
There were other forms of humans around ##, most famous ##ly perhaps ##, Ne ##ander ##thal ##s - ##- these ro ##bust forms of humans ##, compared to the left here with a modern human sk ##elet ##on on the right - ##- that existed in Western Asia and Europe since several hundreds of thousands of years ##.
So an interesting question is ##, what happened when we met ##?
What happened to the Ne ##ander ##thal ##s ##?
And to begin to answer such questions ##, my research group - ##- since over 25 years now - ##- works on methods to extra ##ct DNA from remains of Ne ##ander ##thal ##s and extinct animals that are ten ##s of thousands of years old ##.
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extra ##ct the DNA ##, how you convert it to a form you can sequence ##.
You have to work very care ##fully to avoid conta ##mination of experiments with DNA from your ##self ##.
And this then ##, in conjunction with these methods that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequence ##d very rapidly ##, allowed us last year to present the first version of the Ne ##ander ##thal genome ##, so that any one of you can now look on the Internet ##, on the Ne ##ander ##thal genome ##, or at least on the 55 percent of it that we ##' ##ve been able to re ##cons ##tru ##ct so far ##.
And you can begin to compare it to the genome ##s of people who live today ##.
And one question that you may then want to ask is ##, what happened when we met ##?
Did we mix or not ##?
And the way to ask that question is to look at the Ne ##ander ##thal that comes from Southern Europe and compare it to genome ##s of people who live today ##.
So we then look to do this with pairs of individuals ##, starting with two African ##s ##, looking at the two African genome ##s ##, finding places where they differ from each other ##, and in each case ask ##: What is a Ne ##ander ##thal like ##?
Does it match one African or the other African ##?
And it was a revela ##tion ##.
We traveled through five seas ##, two ocean ##s ##, nine ports ##, and I learned a lot about shipping ##.
And one of the first things that surprise ##d me when I got on board Ken ##dal was ##, where are all the people ##?
I have friends in the Navy who tell me they sail with 1 ##, ##000 sail ##ors at a time ##, but on Ken ##dal there were only 21 crew ##.
Now that ##' ##s because shipping is very efficient ##.
Con ##tainer ##ization has made it very efficient ##.
Ships have auto ##mation now ##.
They can operate with small crew ##s ##.
But it also means that ##, in the words of a port cha ##plain I once met ##, the average sea ##fare ##r you ##' ##re going to find on a contain ##er ship is either tire ##d or ex ##haus ##ted ##, because the pace of modern shipping is quite pun ##ishing for what the shipping calls its human element ##, a strange phrase which they don ##' ##t seem to real ##ize sounds a little bit in ##hum ##an ##.
So most sea ##fare ##rs now working on contain ##er ships often have less than two hours in port at a time ##.
They don ##' ##t have time to re ##lax ##.
They ##' ##re at sea for months at a time ##, and even when they ##' ##re on board ##, they don ##' ##t have access to what a five ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old would take for granted ##, the Internet ##.
And another thing that surprise ##d me when I got on board Ken ##dal was who I was sitting next to - ##- Not the queen ##; I can ##' ##t ima ##gine why they put me under ##nea ##th her portrait - ##- But around that dini ##ng table in the officer ##' ##s sal ##oon ##, I was sitting next to a Burmese gu ##y ##, I was opposite a Romanian ##, a Moldavia ##n ##, an Indian ##.
On the next table was a Chinese gu ##y ##, and in the crew room ##, it was entirely Filipino ##s ##.
So that was a normal working ship ##.
Now how is that possible ##?
Because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last 60 years ##, when most of the general public stopped noti ##cing it ##, was something called an open regi ##str ##y ##, or a flag of con ##veni ##ence ##.
Ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag regi ##str ##y ##.
You can get a flag from the land ##locke ##d nation of Bolivia ##, or Mongolia ##, or North Korea ##, though that ##' ##s not very popular ##.
So we have these very multi ##national ##, global ##, mobile crew ##s on ships ##.
And that was a surprise to me ##.
And when we got to pi ##rate waters ##, down the Bab ##- ##el ##- ##M ##ande ##b str ##ait and into the Indian Ocean ##, the ship changed ##.
And that was also shock ##ing ##, because suddenly ##, I realized ##, as the captain said to me ##, that I had been c ##raz ##y to choose to go through pi ##rate waters on a contain ##er ship ##.
We were no longer allowed on deck ##.
There were double pi ##rate watch ##es ##.
And at that time ##, there were those 544 sea ##fare ##rs being held host ##age ##, and some of them were held host ##age for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of con ##veni ##ence ##.
Not all of them ##, but some of them were ##, because for the minority of uns ##c ##rup ##ulo ##us ship owners ##, it can be easy to hide behind the ano ##nymi ##ty offered by some flag ##s of con ##veni ##ence ##.
What else does our sea blind ##ness mask ##?
Well ##, if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship ##, and look up to the fun ##nel ##, you ##' ##ll see very black smoke ##.
And that ##' ##s because shipping has very tight margin ##s ##, and they want che ##ap fuel ##, so they use something called bun ##ker fuel ##, which was described to me by someone in the tank ##er industry as the dre ##gs of the ref ##iner ##y ##, or just one step up from asp ##halt ##.
I study ant ##s in the desert ##, in the tropical forest and in my kitchen ##, and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live ##.
I ##' ##ve recently realized that ant ##s are using interactions different ##ly in different environments ##, and that got me thinking that we could learn from this about other systems ##, like brain ##s and data networks that we engineer ##, and even cancer ##.
So what all these systems have in common is that there ##' ##s no central control ##.
An ant colony consists of ster ##ile female workers - ##- those are the ant ##s you see walking around [UNK] and then one or more rep ##rodu ##ctive females who just lay the eggs ##.
They don ##' ##t give any instructions ##.
Even though they ##' ##re called queen ##s ##, they don ##' ##t tell any ##body what to do ##.
So in an ant colony ##, there ##' ##s no one in charge ##, and all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple interactions ##.
Ant ##s intera ##ct using sm ##ell ##.
They sm ##ell with their ante ##nna ##e ##, and they intera ##ct with their ante ##nna ##e ##, so when one ant touch ##es another with its ante ##nna ##e ##, it can tell ##, for example ##, if the other ant and what task that other ant has been doing ##.
So here you see a lot of ant ##s moving around and intera ##cting in a lab arena that ##' ##s connected by tubes to two other arena ##s ##.
So when one ant meets another ##, it doesn ##' ##t matter which ant it meets ##, and they ##' ##re actually not trans ##mitting any kind of complicated signal or message ##.
All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ant ##s ##.
And all of these interactions ##, taken together ##, produce a network ##.
So this is the network of the ant ##s that you just saw moving around in the arena ##, and it ##' ##s this constantly shift ##ing network that produces the behavior of the colony ##, like whether all the ant ##s are hi ##ding inside the nest ##, or how many are going out to fora ##ge ##.
A brain actually works in the same way ##, but what ##' ##s great about ant ##s is that you can see the whole network as it happens ##.
There are more than 12 ##, ##000 species of ant ##s ##, in every con ##cei ##vab ##le environment ##, and they ##' ##re using interactions different ##ly to meet different environmental challenges ##.
So one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with is operating costs ##, just what it takes to run the system ##.
And another environmental challenge is resources ##, finding them and collecting them ##.
In the desert ##, operating costs are high because water is s ##car ##ce ##, and the seed ##- ##eat ##ing ant ##s that I study in the desert have to spend water to get water ##.
So an ant outside fora ##ging ##, search ##ing for seeds in the hot sun ##, just lose ##s water into the air ##.
But the colony gets its water by meta ##bol ##izing the fat ##s out of the seeds that they eat ##.
So in this environment ##, interactions are used to activa ##te fora ##ging ##.
An out ##going fora ##ger doesn ##' ##t go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning fora ##gers ##, and what you see are the returning fora ##gers going into the tunnel ##, into the nest ##, and meeting out ##going fora ##gers on their way out ##.
This makes sense for the ant colony ##, because the more food there is out there ##, the more quickly the fora ##gers find it ##, the faster they come back ##, and the more fora ##gers they send out ##.
The system works to stay stopped ##, unless something positive happens ##.
So interactions function to activa ##te fora ##gers ##.
And we ##' ##ve been studying the evolution of this system ##.
First of all ##, there ##' ##s variation ##.
It turns out that colonies are different ##.
On dry days ##, some colonies fora ##ge less ##, so colonies are different in how they manage this trade ##- ##off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds ##.
And we ##' ##re trying to understand why some colonies fora ##ge less than others by thinking about ant ##s as neu ##rons ##, using models from neu ##ros ##cience ##.
I ##' ##m a veteran of the stars ##hip Enterprise ##.
I soa ##red through the gala ##xy driving a huge stars ##hip with a crew made up of people from all over this world ##, many different races ##, many different cultures ##, many different heritage ##s ##, all working together ##, and our mission was to explore strange new world ##s ##, to seek out new life and new civili ##zation ##s ##, to bold ##ly go where no one has gone before ##.
Well [UNK] [UNK] I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan who went to America ##, bold ##ly going to a strange new world ##, seeking new opportunities ##.
My mother was born in Sacramento ##, California ##.
My father was a San Francisca ##n ##.
They met and married in Los Angeles ##, and I was born there ##.
I was four years old when Pearl Harbor was bombe ##d on December 7 ##, 1941 by Japan ##, and over ##night ##, the world was plu ##nge ##d into a world war ##.
America suddenly was s ##we ##pt up by hy ##steria ##.
Japanese ##- ##A ##meri ##cans ##, American citizens of Japanese ancestry ##, were looked on with sus ##pic ##ion and fear and with out ##right hat ##red simply because we happened to look like the people that bombe ##d Pearl Harbor ##.
And the hy ##steria grew and grew until in February 1942 ##, the president of the United States ##, Franklin Del ##ano Roosevelt ##, ordered all Japanese ##- ##A ##meri ##cans on the West Coast of America to be sum ##mari ##ly rounded up with no charges ##, with no trial ##, with no due process ##.
Due process ##, this is a core pi ##llar of our justice system ##.
That all disappeared ##.
We were to be rounded up and imprisoned in 10 bar ##bed ##- ##wir ##e prison camps in some of the most des ##olat ##e places in America ##: the bli ##ster ##ing hot desert of Arizona ##, the sul ##try s ##wamp ##s of Arkansas ##, the waste ##lands of Wyoming ##, Idaho ##, Utah ##, Colorado ##, and two of the most des ##olat ##e places in California ##.
On April 20th ##, I celebrated my fifth birthday ##, and just a few weeks after my birthday ##, my parents got my younger brother ##, my baby sister and me up very early one morning ##, and they dressed us hur ##ried ##ly ##.
My brother and I were in the living room looking out the front window ##, and we saw two soldiers march ##ing up our drive ##way ##.
They carried bay ##onet ##s on their rifle ##s ##.
They sto ##mpe ##d up the front por ##ch and bang ##ed on the door ##.
My father answer ##ed it ##, and the soldiers ordered us out of our home ##.
My father gave my brother and me small lu ##gga ##ges to carry ##, and we walk ##ed out and stood on the drive ##way waiting for our mother to come out ##, and when my mother finally came out ##, she had our baby sister in one arm ##, a huge du ##ffel bag in the other ##, and tea ##rs were streaming down both her che ##eks ##.
I will never be able to for ##get that scene ##.
It is burned into my memory ##.
We were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other Japanese ##- ##A ##meri ##can families ##.
There were guards stationed at both ends of each car ##, as if we were criminal ##s ##.
We were taken two third ##s of the way across the country ##, rock ##ing on that train for four days and three nights ##, to the s ##wamp ##s of Arkansas ##.
I still remember the bar ##bed wire fe ##nce that confine ##d me ##.
I remember the tall sent ##ry tower with the machine guns pointed at us ##.
I remember the search ##light that followed me when I made the night runs from my barra ##ck to the lat ##rine ##.
But to five ##- ##ye ##ar ##- ##old me ##, I thought it was kind of nic ##e that they ##' ##d lit the way for me to pe ##e ##.
I was a child ##, too young to understand the circumstances of my being there ##.
Children are ama ##zing ##ly ada ##pta ##ble ##.
What would be grote ##sque ##ly ab ##normal became my normal ##ity in the prisoner of war camps ##.
And you even find a church ##.
And on the 30th floor ##, there is a g ##ym where all the weight ##s and bar ##bell ##s are made out of the left ##over pull ##ey ##s from the elevato ##rs which were never installed ##.
From the outside ##, behind this always ##- ##chang ##ing facade ##, you see how the fixed concrete beam ##s provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic ##, int ##uit ##ive way that respond ##s directly to their needs ##.
Let ##' ##s go now to Africa ##, to Nigeria ##, to a community called Ma ##kok ##o ##, a sl ##um where 150 ##, ##000 people live just meters above the Lagos Lago ##on ##.
While it may appear to be a completely cha ##otic place ##, when you see it from above ##, there seems to be a whole grid of water ##ways and canal ##s connecting each and every home ##.
From the main dock ##, people board long wooden can ##oes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the ex ##pan ##sive area ##.
When out on the water ##, it ##' ##s clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living ##.
Even the can ##oes become variety stores where la ##dies pad ##dle from house to house ##, selling anything from too ##th ##pas ##te to fresh fruits ##.
Behind every window and door frame ##, you ##' ##ll see a small child peer ##ing back at you ##, and while Ma ##kok ##o seems to be pack ##ed with people ##, what ##' ##s more shock ##ing is actually the amount of children pour ##ing out of every building ##.
The population growth in Nigeria ##, and especially in these areas like Ma ##kok ##o ##, are pain ##ful re ##min ##ders of how out of control things really are ##.
In Ma ##kok ##o ##, very few systems and infrastructure ##s exist ##.
Electric ##ity is ri ##gged and fresh ##est water comes from self ##- ##bu ##ilt well ##s throughout the area ##.
This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water ##, so fishing and boat ##- ##making are common profession ##s ##.
You ##' ##ll have a set of entrepreneur ##s who have set up businesses throughout the area ##, like bar ##bers ##hop ##s ##, CD and DVD stores ##, movie theaters ##, tail ##ors ##, everything is there ##.
There is even a photo studio where you see the sort of asp ##iration to live in a real house or to be associated with a far ##away place ##, like that hotel in Sweden ##.
On this particular evening ##, I came across this live band dressed to the T in their co ##ord ##inat ##ing out ##fit ##s ##.
They were floating through the canal ##s in a large can ##oe with a fitted ##- ##out generator for all of the community to enjoy ##.
By night ##fall ##, the area becomes almost pitch black ##, save for a small light ##bul ##b or a fire ##.
What originally brought me to Ma ##kok ##o was this project from a friend of mine ##, Kun ##lé Ad ##eye ##mi ##, who recently finished building this three ##- ##stor ##y floating school for the kids in Ma ##kok ##o ##.
With this entire village existing on the water ##, public space is very limited ##, so now that the school is finished ##, the ground floor is a play ##ground for the kids ##, but when classes are out ##, the platform is just like a town square ##, where the fish ##erm ##en men ##d their net ##s and floating shop ##keeper ##s dock their boats ##.
Another place I ##' ##d like to share with you is the Za ##bba ##leen in Cairo ##.
They ##' ##re descendants of farmers who began mig ##rating from the upper Egypt in the ' ##40 ##s ##, and today they make their living by collecting and re ##cy ##clin ##g waste from homes from all over Cairo ##.
For years ##, the Za ##bba ##leen would live in makes ##hi ##ft villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities ##, but in the early 1980s ##, they settled on the Mo ##kat ##tam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city ##.
Today ##, they live in this area ##, approximately 50 ##, ##000 to 70 ##, ##000 people ##, who live in this community of self ##- ##bu ##ilt multi ##- ##stor ##y houses where up to three generations live in one structure ##.
While these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid ##, each family speciali ##zing in a certain form of re ##cy ##clin ##g means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for gar ##ba ##ge ##- ##rela ##ted activities and the upper floor is dedicated to living space ##.
I find it in ##cre ##dible to see how these pi ##les and pi ##les of gar ##ba ##ge are invisible to the people who live there ##, like this very distinguished man who is pos ##ing while all this gar ##ba ##ge is sort of streaming out behind him ##, or like these two young men who are sitting and chat ##ting amongst these tons of gar ##ba ##ge ##.
While to most of us ##, living amongst these pi ##les and pi ##les of gar ##ba ##ge may seem totally uni ##nha ##bita ##ble ##, to those in the Za ##bba ##leen ##, this is just a different type of normal ##.
In all these places I ##' ##ve talk ##ed about today ##, what I do find fa ##sci ##nating is that there ##' ##s really no such thing as normal ##, and it proves that people are able to ada ##pt to any kind of situation ##.
Throughout the day ##, it ##' ##s quite common to come across a small party taking place in the streets ##, just like this engagement party ##.
In this tradition ##, the br ##ide ##- ##to ##- ##be displays all of their belonging ##s ##, which they soon bring to their new husband ##.
Unfortunately ##, global carbon emissions from def ##ores ##tation now equal ##s the global transportation sector ##.
That ##' ##s all ships ##, air ##plane ##s ##, trains and automobile ##s combined ##.
So it ##' ##s understand ##able that policy nego ##tia ##tors have been working hard to reduce def ##ores ##tation ##, but they ##' ##re doing it on landscape ##s that are hard ##ly known to science ##.
If you don ##' ##t know where the carbon is exactly ##, in detail ##, how can you know what you ##' ##re losing ##?
Basic ##ally ##, we need a high ##- ##tech accounting system ##.
With our system ##, we ##' ##re able to see the carbon stock ##s of tropical forests in ut ##ter detail ##.
The red shows ##, obvious ##ly ##, closed ##- ##cano ##py tropical forest ##, and then you see the co ##okie cutting ##, or the cutting of the forest in yellow ##s and green ##s ##.
It ##' ##s like cutting a ca ##ke except this ca ##ke is about w ##hale deep ##.
And yet ##, we can zoo ##m in and see the forest and the trees at the same time ##.
And what ##' ##s ama ##zing is ##, even though we flew very high above this forest ##, later on in analysis ##, we can go in and actually experience the tree ##tro ##ps ##, leaf by leaf ##, branch by branch ##, just as the other species that live in this forest experience it along with the trees themselves ##.
We ##' ##ve been using the technology to explore and to actually put out the first carbon ge ##ographie ##s in high resolution in far ##away places like the Amazon Basin and not ##- ##so ##- ##far ##away places like the United States and Central America ##.
What I ##' ##m going to do is I ##' ##m going to take you on a high ##- ##res ##olu ##tion ##, first ##- ##time tour of the carbon landscape ##s of Peru and then Panama ##.
The colors are going to be going from red to blue ##.
Red is extremely high carbon stock ##s ##, your largest cathedral forests you can ima ##gine ##, and blue are very low carbon stock ##s ##.
And let me tell you ##, Peru alone is an ama ##zing place ##, totally unknown in terms of its carbon ge ##ography until today ##.
We can fly to this area in northern Peru and see super high carbon stock ##s in red ##, and the Amazon River and flood ##plain cutting right through it ##.
We can go to an area of ut ##ter de ##vas ##tation caused by def ##ores ##tation in blue ##, and the virus of def ##ores ##tation spread ##ing out in orange ##.
We can also fly to the southern Andes to see the tree line and see exactly how the carbon ge ##ography ends as we go up into the mountain system ##.
And we can go to the biggest s ##wamp in the western Amazon ##.
It ##' ##s a water ##y dream ##world aki ##n to Jim Cameron ##' ##s " ##A ##vata ##r ##. ##"
We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries ##, Panama ##, and see also a huge range of carbon variation ##, from high in red to low in blue ##.
Unfortunately ##, most of the carbon is lost in the low ##lands ##, but what you see that ##' ##s left ##, in terms of high carbon stock ##s in green ##s and red ##s ##, is the st ##uff that ##' ##s up in the mountains ##.
One interesting exception to this is right in the middle of your screen ##.
You ##' ##re seeing the bu ##ffer zone around the Panama Canal ##.
That ##' ##s in the red ##s and yellow ##s ##.
The canal authorities are using force to protect their waters ##hed and global commerce ##.
This kind of carbon mapping has transformed conservation and resource policy development ##.
It ##' ##s really ad ##vancing our ability to save forests and to cu ##rb climate change ##.
My second question ##: How do we prepare for climate change in a place like the Amazon rain ##for ##est ##?
Let me tell you ##, I spend a lot of time in these places ##, and we ##' ##re seeing the climate changing already ##.
Temperatur ##es are increasing ##, and what ##' ##s really happen ##ing is we ##' ##re getting a lot of dro ##ught ##s ##, recurring dro ##ught ##s ##.
The 2010 meg ##a ##- ##dro ##ught is shown here with red showing an area about the size of Western Europe ##.
The Amazon was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself drie ##d up partially ##, as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide ##.
What we found is that in very remote areas ##, these dro ##ught ##s are having a big negative impact on tropical forests ##.
For example ##, these are all of the dead trees in red that suffered mortal ##ity following the 2010 dro ##ught ##.
This area happens to be on the border of Peru and Brazil ##, totally une ##x ##plo ##red ##, almost totally unknown scientifica ##lly ##.
So what we think ##, as Earth scientists ##, is species are going to have to mig ##rate with climate change from the east in Brazil all the way west into the Andes and up into the mountains in order to mini ##mi ##ze their exposure to climate change ##.
One of the problems with this is that humans are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak ##.
Look at this 100 ##- ##s ##qua ##re ##- ##kilometer gas ##h in the forest created by gold mine ##rs ##.
To do that ##, we need to charter a research boat ##.
This is the James Cook ##, an ocean ##- ##cla ##ss research vessel mo ##ored up in Tenerife ##.
Look ##s beautiful ##, right ##?
Great ##, if you ##' ##re not a great marine ##r ##.
Sometimes it looks a little more like this ##.
This is us trying to make sure that we don ##' ##t lose precio ##us samples ##.
Every ##one ##' ##s s ##cu ##rry ##ing around ##, and I get ter ##rib ##ly seas ##ick ##, so it ##' ##s not always a lot of fun ##, but overall it is ##.
So we ##' ##ve got to become a really good map ##per to do this ##.
You don ##' ##t see that kind of sp ##ecta ##cular coral abu ##ndan ##ce every ##where ##.
It is global and it is deep ##, but we need to really find the right places ##.
We just saw a global map ##, and over ##lai ##d was our cruise passage from last year ##.
This was a seven ##- ##week cruise ##, and this is us ##, having made our own maps of about 75 ##, ##000 square kilometers of the sea ##f ##lo ##or in seven weeks ##, but that ##' ##s only a tin ##y fraction of the sea ##f ##lo ##or ##.
We ##' ##re traveling from west to east ##, over part of the ocean that would look feature ##less on a big ##- ##scal ##e map ##, but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest ##.
So with the maps that we make on board ##, we get about 100 ##- ##meter resolution ##, enough to pick out areas to de ##ploy our equipment ##, but not enough to see very much ##.
To do that ##, we need to fly remote ##ly ##- ##oper ##ated vehicles about five meters off the sea ##f ##lo ##or ##.
And if we do that ##, we can get maps that are one ##- ##meter resolution down thousands of meters ##.
Here is a remote ##ly ##- ##oper ##ated vehicle ##, You can see an array of big lights on the top ##.
There are high ##- ##de ##fini ##tion cameras ##, mani ##pul ##ator arms ##, and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples ##.
Here we are on our first div ##e of this particular cruise ##, plu ##ngin ##g down into the ocean ##.
We go pretty fast to make sure the remote ##ly operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships ##.
And we go down ##, and these are the kinds of things you see ##.
These are deep sea sp ##onge ##s ##, meter scale ##.
This is a swimming hol ##oth ##uria ##n - ##- it ##' ##s a small sea sl ##ug ##, basic ##ally ##.
This is slow ##ed down ##.
Most of the footage I ##' ##m showing you is speed ##ed up ##, because all of this takes a lot of time ##.
This is a beautiful hol ##oth ##uria ##n as well ##.
And this animal you ##' ##re going to see coming up was a big surprise ##.
I ##' ##ve never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprise ##d ##.
This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit tri ##gger ##- ##ha ##ppy ##, and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past ##.
It ##' ##s called a p ##yr ##oso ##me or colonial tun ##icate ##, if you like ##.
This wasn ##' ##t what we were looking for ##.
We were looking for coral ##s ##, deep sea coral ##s ##.
You ##' ##re going to see a picture of one in a moment ##.
It ##' ##s small ##, about five centimeter ##s high ##.
It ##' ##s made of calcium carbon ##ate ##, so you can see its tenta ##cles there ##, moving in the ocean current ##s ##.
An organi ##sm like this probably lives for about a hundred years ##.
And as it grows ##, it takes in chemical ##s from the ocean ##.
And the chemical ##s ##, or the amount of chemical ##s ##, depends on the temperature ##; it depends on the pH ##, it depends on the nu ##trie ##nts ##.
And if we can understand how these chemical ##s get into the sk ##elet ##on ##, we can then go back ##, collect fossil specimens ##, and re ##cons ##tru ##ct what the ocean used to look like in the past ##.
And here you can see us collecting that coral with a va ##cuum system ##, and we put it into a sam ##pling contain ##er ##.
We can do this very care ##fully ##, I should add ##.
Some of these organisms live even longer ##.
This is a black coral called Lei ##opa ##thes ##, an image taken by my coll ##eague ##, Brendan R ##oar ##k ##, about 500 meters below Hawaii ##.
Now the traditional method of survey ##ing carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of bin ##oc ##ular ##s to look up in the tree ##top ##s where you might find an orang ##utan or its nest ##.
Now as you can ima ##gine ##, that is a very time ##- ##cons ##umi ##ng ##, labor ##- ##inte ##nsi ##ve ##, and cost ##ly process ##, so we were hop ##ing that dro ##nes could significantly reduce the cost of survey ##ing for orang ##utan populations in Indonesia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia ##.
So we were very ex ##cited when we captured our first pair of orang ##utan nest ##s on camera ##.
And this is it ##; this is the first ever picture of orang ##utan nest ##s taken with a dro ##ne ##.
Since then we have taken pictures of dozen ##s of these nest ##s from around various parts of Southeast Asia ##, and we ##' ##re now working with computer scientists to develop algorithm ##s that can automatically count the number of nest ##s from the thousands of photos we ##' ##ve collected so far ##.
But nest ##s are not the only objects these dro ##nes can det ##ect ##.
This is a wild orang ##utan ha ##ppi ##ly feeding on top of a palm tree ##, seem ##ingly ob ##liv ##ious to our dro ##ne that was flying over ##head ##, not once but several times ##.
We ##' ##ve also taken pictures of other animals including forest bu ##ffa ##los in Gabon ##, ele ##pha ##nts ##, and even tur ##tle nest ##s ##.
But be ##sides taking pictures of just the animals themselves ##, we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in ##, because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats ##.
Sometimes ##, we zoo ##m out a little and look at other things that might be happen ##ing in the landscape ##.
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra ##.
Now oil palm is a major driver of def ##ores ##tation in that part of the world ##, so we wanted to use this new dro ##ne technology to keep track of the spread of these plantation ##s in Southeast Asia ##.
But dro ##nes could also be used to keep track of illegal log ##ging activities ##.
This is a recently log ##ged forest ##, again in Sumatra ##.
You could even still see the process ##ed wooden plan ##ks left on the ground ##.
But perhaps the most ex ##citing part about taking pictures from the air is we could later st ##itch these pictures together using special software to create a map of the entire landscape ##, and this map gives us crucial information for monitoring land use change ##, to let us know where and when plantation ##s might be expanding ##, where forests might be contract ##ing ##, or where fires might be breaking out ##.
A ##eria ##l images could also be process ##ed to produce three ##- ##dim ##ension ##al computer models of forests ##.
Now these models are not just visual ##ly appeal ##ing ##, but they are also ge ##ome ##trica ##lly accurate ##, which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees ##, calcul ##ate surface area ##, the volume of vegetation ##, and so on ##, all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests ##.
Recent ##ly ##, we ##' ##ve also begun experiment ##ing with thermal imaging cameras ##.
Now these cameras can det ##ect heat ##- ##emi ##tting objects from the ground ##, and therefore they are very useful for det ##ect ##ing po ##acher ##s or their camp ##fire ##s at night ##.
So I ##' ##ve told you quite a lot about what conservation dro ##nes are ##, how you might operate one of these dro ##nes ##, and what a dro ##ne could do for you ##.
I will now tell you where conservation dro ##nes are being used around the world ##.
We built our first prototype dro ##nes in Switzerland ##.
We brought a few of these to Indonesia for the first few test flights ##.
Since then ##, we ##' ##ve been building dro ##nes for our coll ##abo ##rators from around the world ##, and these include fellow bio ##logist ##s and partners from major conservation organizations ##.
Per ##ha ##ps the best and most re ##ward ##ing part about working with these coll ##abo ##rators is the feedback they give us on how to improve our dro ##nes ##.
Building dro ##nes for us is a constant work in progress ##.
We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range ##, their ru ##gged ##ness ##, and the amount of pay ##load they can carry ##.
We also work with coll ##abo ##rators to discover new ways of using these dro ##nes ##.
I had ##, to me ##, a fa ##sci ##nating job writing about world affairs ##, but I could never separate my ##self enough from them to hear my ##self think - ##- or really ##, to understand if I was truly happy ##.
And so ##, I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the back ##street ##s of Kyoto ##, Japan ##, which was the place that had long ex ##erted a strong ##, really mysterious gravi ##tation ##al pull on me ##.
Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it ##; I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it ##.
But it ##' ##s also ##, as you all know ##, a beautiful city en ##cir ##cle ##d by hills ##, filled with more than 2 ##, ##000 temples and sh ##rine ##s ##, where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more ##.
And quite soon after I moved there ##, I ended up where I still am with my wife ##, formerly our kids ##, in a two ##- ##room apartment in the middle of now ##here where we have no bi ##cycle ##, no car ##, no TV I can understand ##, and I still have to support my loved ones as a travel writer and a journalist ##, so clearly this is not ideal for job advance ##ment or for cultural ex ##cite ##ment
or for social diversi ##on ##.
But I realized that it gives me what I prize most ##, which is days and hours ##.
I have never once had to use a cell phone there ##.
I almost never have to look at the time ##, and every morning when I wake up ##, really the day stretch ##es in front of me like an open me ##adow ##.
And when life throw ##s up one of its nas ##ty surprise ##s ##, as it will ##, more than once ##, when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression ##, or a car suddenly ve ##ers in front of mine on the free ##way ##, I know ##, in my bones ##, that it ##' ##s the time I ##' ##ve spent going now ##here that is going to sus ##tain me much more than all the time I ##' ##ve spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island ##.
I ##' ##ll always be a travel ##er - ##- my live ##lih ##ood depends on it - ##- but one of the beau ##ties of travel is that it allows you to bring still ##ness into the motion and the com ##mot ##ion of the world ##.
I once got on a plane in Frankfurt ##, Germany ##, and a young German woman came down and sat next to me and engaged me in a very friendly conversation for about 30 minutes ##, and then she just turned around and sat still for 12 hours ##.
She didn ##' ##t once turn on her video monitor ##, she never pulled out a book ##, she didn ##' ##t even go to sleep ##, she just sat still ##, and something of her clar ##ity and cal ##m really im ##parte ##d itself to me ##.
I ##' ##ve notice ##d more and more people taking con ##sci ##ous measures these days to try to open up a space inside their lives ##.
Some people go to black ##- ##hole resort ##s where they ##' ##ll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their cell phone and their lap ##top to the front des ##k on arrival ##.
Some people I know ##, just before they go to sleep ##, instead of s ##cro ##lling through their messages or check ##ing out YouTube ##, just turn out the lights and listen to some music ##, and notice that they sleep much better and wake up much ref ##res ##hed ##.
I was once fortuna ##te enough to drive into the high ##, dark mountains behind Los Angeles ##, where the great poet and singer and international heart ##th ##ro ##b Leonard Cohen was living and working for many years as a full ##- ##time mon ##k in the Mount Bald ##y Zen Center ##.
And I wasn ##' ##t entirely surprise ##d when the record that he released at the age of 77 ##, to which he gave the del ##ibe ##rate ##ly uns ##ex ##y title of " ##O ##ld Ideas ##, ##" went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world ##, hit the top five in nine others ##.
Something in us ##, I think ##, is c ##ry ##ing out for the sense of int ##ima ##cy and depth that we get from people like that ##.
who take the time and trouble to sit still ##.
And I think many of us have the sensa ##tion ##, I certainly do ##, that we ##' ##re standing about two inches away from a huge screen ##, and it ##' ##s noi ##sy and it ##' ##s crowd ##ed and it ##' ##s changing with every second ##, and that screen is our lives ##.
And it ##' ##s only by step ##ping back ##, and then further back ##, and holding still ##, that we can begin to see what the can ##vas means and to catch the larger picture ##.
And a few people do that for us by going now ##here ##.
So ##, in an age of ac ##cel ##eration ##, nothing can be more ex ##hil ##arat ##ing than going slow ##.
And in an age of dis ##tract ##ion ##, nothing is so lu ##xu ##rious as paying attention ##.
And in an age of constant movement ##, nothing is so ur ##gent as sitting still ##.
So you can go on your next va ##cation to Paris or Hawaii ##, or New Orleans ##; I bet you ##' ##ll have a won ##der ##ful time ##.
But ##, if you want to come back home alive and full of fresh hope ##, in love with the world ##, I think you might want to try considering going now ##here ##.
I ##' ##m a gar ##ba ##ge man ##.
And you might find it interesting that I became a gar ##ba ##ge man ##, because I absolute ##ly hat ##e waste ##.
I hope ##, within the next 10 minutes ##, to change the way you think about a lot of the st ##uff in your life ##.
And I ##' ##d like to start at the very beginning ##.
Think back when you were just a ki ##d ##.
How did look at the st ##uff in your life ##?
Per ##ha ##ps it was like these to ##ddle ##r rules ##: It ##' ##s my st ##uff if I saw it first ##.
The entire pi ##le is my st ##uff if I ##' ##m building something ##.
The more st ##uff that ##' ##s mine ##, the better ##.
And of course ##, it ##' ##s your st ##uff if it ##' ##s broken ##.
Well after spending about 20 years in the re ##cy ##clin ##g industry ##, it ##' ##s become pretty clear to me that we don ##' ##t necessarily leave these to ##ddle ##r rules behind as we develop into adults ##.
And let me tell you why I have that perspective ##.
Because each and every day at our re ##cy ##clin ##g plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people ##' ##s disc ##arde ##d st ##uff ##.
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of st ##uff ##, but it ##' ##s a tin ##y drop of the durable goods that are dispose ##d each and every year around the world - ##- well less than one percent ##.
In fact ##, the United Nations estimates that there ##' ##s about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets disc ##arde ##d around the world each and every year - ##- and that ##' ##s one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream ##.
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobile ##s and so forth ##, that number well more than doubles ##.
And of course ##, the more developed the country ##, the bigger these mountains ##.
Now when you see these mountains ##, most people think of gar ##ba ##ge ##.
We see above ##- ##ground mines ##.
And the reason we see mines is because there ##' ##s a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this st ##uff in the first place ##.
And it ##' ##s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extra ##ct these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams ##.
Because as we ##' ##ve heard all week at T ##ED ##, the world ##' ##s getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more st ##uff ##.
And of course ##, they want the toy ##s and the tools that many of us take for granted ##.
And what goes into making those toy ##s and tools that we use every single day ##?
It ##' ##s mostly many types of plastic ##s and many types of metal ##s ##.
And the metal ##s ##, we typically get from ore that we mine in ever wide ##ning mines and ever deep ##ening mines around the world ##.
And the plastic ##s ##, we get from oil ##, which we go to more remote locations and dr ##ill ever deep ##er well ##s to extra ##ct ##.
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we ##' ##re already starting to see today ##.
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end ##- ##of ##- ##life st ##uff and starting to re ##cycle our end ##- ##of ##- ##life st ##uff ##, particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have re ##cy ##clin ##g policies in place that require that this st ##uff be re ##cycle ##d in a responsible manner ##.
Most of what ##' ##s extra ##cted from our end ##- ##of ##- ##life st ##uff ##, if it makes it to a re ##cycle ##r ##, are the metal ##s ##.
To put that in perspective - ##- and I ##' ##m using steel as a pro ##xy here for metal ##s ##, because it ##' ##s the most common metal - ##- if your st ##uff makes it to a re ##cycle ##r ##, probably over 90 percent of the metal ##s are going to be recovered and re ##used for another purpose ##.
Plastic ##s are a whole other story ##: well less than 10 percent are recovered ##.
In fact ##, it ##' ##s more like five percent ##.
Most of it ##' ##s in ##cine ##rated or land ##fil ##led ##.
Now most people think that ##' ##s because plastic ##s are a throw ##- ##away material ##, have very little value ##.
But actually ##, plastic ##s are several times more valuable than steel ##.
And there ##' ##s more plastic ##s produced and con ##sumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel ##.
So why is such a pl ##enti ##ful and valuable material not recovered at any ##where near the rate of the less valuable material ##?
So now I ##' ##m going to show you a number of projects that we ##' ##ve built ##, from one ##- ##dim ##ension ##al ##, two ##- ##dim ##ension ##al ##, three ##- ##dim ##ension ##al and even four ##- ##dim ##ension ##al systems ##.
So in one ##- ##dim ##ension ##al systems - ##- this is a project called the self ##- ##fold ##ing proteins ##.
And the idea is that you take the three ##- ##dim ##ension ##al structure of a protein - ##- in this case it ##' ##s the c ##ram ##bin protein - ##- you take the back ##bone - ##- so no cross ##- ##link ##ing ##, no environmental interactions - ##- and you break that down into a series of components ##.
And then we em ##bed elas ##tic ##.
And when I throw this up into the air and catch it ##, it has the full three ##- ##dim ##ension ##al structure of the protein ##, all of the int ##rica ##cies ##.
And this gives us a tan ##gi ##ble model of the three ##- ##dim ##ension ##al protein and how it f ##old ##s and all of the int ##rica ##cies of the geometry ##.
So we can study this as a physical ##, int ##uit ##ive model ##.
And we ##' ##re also trans ##lating that into two ##- ##dim ##ension ##al systems - ##- so flat sheet ##s that can self ##- ##fold into three ##- ##dim ##ension ##al structures ##.
In three dimensions ##, we did a project last year at T ##ED ##G ##lob ##al with Auto ##des ##k and Arthur Olson where we looked at autonomous parts - ##- so individual parts not pre ##- ##con ##nect ##ed that can come together on their own ##.
And we built 500 of these glass be ##aker ##s ##.
They had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and match ##ed ##.
And we gave them away to all the T ##ED ##sters ##.
And so these became int ##uit ##ive models to understand how molecular self ##- ##asse ##mb ##ly works at the human scale ##.
This is the poli ##o virus ##.
You sh ##ake it hard and it breaks apart ##.
And then you sh ##ake it random ##ly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own ##.
And this is demo ##nst ##rating that through random energy ##, we can build non ##- ##rando ##m shape ##s ##.
We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale ##.
Last year at T ##ED Long Beach ##, we built an installation that build ##s installations ##.
The idea was ##, could we self ##- ##asse ##mble furniture ##- ##scal ##e objects ##?
So we built a large rota ##ting chamber ##, and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slow ##er ##, adding energy to the system and getting an int ##uit ##ive understanding of how self ##- ##asse ##mb ##ly works and how we could use this as a mac ##ros ##cale construction or manufacturing technique for products ##.
So remember ##, I said 4 ##D ##.
So today for the first time ##, we ##' ##re un ##vei ##ling a new project ##, which is a collaboration with St ##ratas ##ys ##, and it ##' ##s called 4 ##D printing ##.
The idea behind 4 ##D printing is that you take multi ##- ##material 3D printing - ##- so you can de ##posit multiple materials - ##- and you add a new capability ##, which is transformation ##, that right off the bed ##, the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own ##.
And this is like robot ##ics without wire ##s or motors ##.
So you completely print this part ##, and it can transform into something else ##.
We also worked with Auto ##des ##k on a software they ##' ##re developing called Project C ##y ##borg ##.
Our calculation shows that quantum tunnel ##ing of the Hi ##ggs field is not likely to occur in the next 10 to the 100 years ##, and this is a very long time ##.
It ##' ##s even longer than the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government ##.
Even so ##, we will be long gone by then ##.
In about five billion years ##, our sun will become a red giant ##, as large as the Earth ##' ##s orbit ##, and our Earth will be kap ##ut ##, and in a thousand billion years ##, if dark energy keeps on fuel ##ing space expansion at the present rate ##, you will not even be able to see as far as your toe ##s ##, because everything around you expand ##s at a rate faster than the speed of light ##.
So it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the Hi ##ggs field collapse ##.
But the reason why I am interested in the transition of the Hi ##ggs field is because I want to address the question ##, why is the Hi ##ggs bos ##on mass so special ##?
Why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition ##?
Theo ##reti ##cal ph ##ys ##icist ##s always ask " ##w ##hy ##" questions ##.
More than how a phenomenon works ##, theoretical ph ##ys ##icist ##s are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works ##.
We think that this these " ##w ##hy ##" questions can give us c ##lue ##s about the fundamental principles of nature ##.
And indeed ##, a possible answer to my question opens up new universe ##s ##, literally ##.
It has been sp ##ecu ##lated that our universe is only a bu ##bble in a soap ##y multi ##verse made out of a multitud ##e of bu ##bble ##s ##, and each bu ##bble is a different universe with different fundamental constant ##s and different physical laws ##.
And in this context ##, you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Hi ##ggs mass ##.
Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multi ##verse ##.
It would be something like what happens with sand dun ##es on a beach ##.
In principle ##, you could ima ##gine to find sand dun ##es of any slope angle in a beach ##, and yet ##, the slope angles of sand dun ##es are typically around 30 ##, 35 degrees ##.
And the reason is simple ##: because wind build ##s up the sand ##, gravity makes it fall ##.
As a result ##, the vast majority of sand dun ##es have slope angles around the critical value ##, near to collapse ##.
And something similar could happen for the Hi ##ggs bos ##on mass in the multi ##verse ##.
In the majority of bu ##bble universe ##s ##, the Hi ##ggs mass could be around the critical value ##, near to a cos ##mic collapse of the Hi ##ggs field ##, because of two competing effects ##, just as in the case of sand ##.
My story does not have an end ##, because we still don ##' ##t know the end of the story ##.
This is science in progress ##, and to solve the mystery ##, we need more data ##, and hope ##fully ##, the L ##HC will soon add new c ##lue ##s to this story ##.
Just one number ##, the Hi ##ggs bos ##on mass ##, and yet ##, out of this number we learn so much ##.
I started from a hypothesis ##, that the known particles are all there is in the universe ##, even beyond the domain explored so far ##.
From this ##, we discovered that the Hi ##ggs field that per ##mea ##tes space ##- ##time may be standing on a kn ##ife edge ##, ready for cos ##mic collapse ##, and we discovered that this may be a hin ##t that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach ##, the multi ##verse ##.
But I don ##' ##t know if my hypothesis is right ##.
That ##' ##s how physics works ##: A single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alle ##y ##.
But which ##ever it turns out to be ##, there is one thing I ##' ##m sure of ##: The journey will be full of surprise ##s ##.
It is actually a reality today that you can download products from the Web - ##- product data ##, I should say ##, from the Web - ##- perhaps t ##we ##ak it and personal ##ize it to your own pre ##ference or your own taste ##, and have that information sent to a des ##ktop machine that will fa ##brica ##te it for you on the spot ##.
We can actually build for you ##, very rapidly ##, a physical object ##.
And the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called add ##itive manufacturing ##, or 3D printing ##.
This is a 3D print ##er ##.
They have been around for almost 30 years now ##, which is quite ama ##zing to think of ##, but they ##' ##re only just starting to filter into the public arena ##.
And typically ##, you would take data ##, like the data of a pen here ##, which would be a ge ##ome ##tric representation of that product in 3D ##, and we would pass that data with material into a machine ##.
And a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that product would be built ##.
And we can take out the physical product ##, and ready to use ##, or to ##, perhaps ##, ass ##emble into something else ##.
But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years ##, why don ##' ##t we know about them ##?
Because typically they ##' ##ve been too in ##efficient ##, ina ##cce ##ssi ##ble ##, they ##' ##ve not been fast enough ##, they ##' ##ve been quite expensive ##.
But today ##, it is becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful ##.
Many barrier ##s are breaking down ##.
That means that you gu ##ys will soon be able to access one of these machines ##, if not this minute ##.
And it will change and dis ##rupt the landscape of manufacturing ##, and most certainly our lives ##, our businesses and the lives of our children ##.
So how does it work ##?
It typically reads CAD data ##, which is a product design data created on professional product design programs ##.
And here you can see an engineer - ##- it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer - ##- create a product in 3D ##.
And this data gets sent to a machine that sl ##ices the data into two ##- ##dim ##ension ##al representation ##s of that product all the way through - ##- almost like sl ##ici ##ng it like sala ##mi ##.
And that data ##, layer by layer ##, gets passed through the machine ##, starting at the base of the product and de ##posit ##ing material ##, layer upon layer ##, in ##fus ##ing the new layer of materials to the old layer in an add ##itive process ##.
And this material that ##' ##s de ##posite ##d either starts as a liquid form or a material po ##wder form ##.
And the bond ##ing process can happen by either me ##lti ##ng and de ##posit ##ing or de ##posit ##ing then me ##lti ##ng ##.
In this case ##, we can see a laser sin ##tering machine developed by E ##OS ##.
It ##' ##s actually using a laser to fu ##se the new layer of material to the old layer ##.
And over time - ##- quite rapidly actually ##, in a number of hours - ##- we can build a physical product ##, ready to take out of the machine and use ##.
And this is quite an extraordinary idea ##, but it is reality today ##.
So all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way ##.
They were all 3D printed ##.
And you can see ##, they ##' ##re ranging from sh ##oes ##, rings that were made out of sta ##in ##less st ##eal ##, phone covers out of plastic ##, all the way through to spin ##al im ##plant ##s ##, for example ##, that were created out of medical ##- ##grade ti ##tani ##um ##, and engine parts ##.
But what you ##' ##ll notice about all of these products is they ##' ##re very ##, very int ##rica ##te ##.
The design is quite extraordinary ##.
Because we ##' ##re taking this data in 3D form ##, sl ##ici ##ng it up before it gets past the machine ##, we can actually create structures that are more int ##rica ##te than any other manufacturing technology - ##- or ##, in fact ##, are impossible to build in any other way ##.
And you can create parts with moving components ##, hin ##ges ##, parts within parts ##.
So in some cases ##, we can ab ##olis ##h totally the need for manual labor ##.
It sounds great ##.
It is great ##.
We can have 3D print ##ers today that build structures like these ##.
This is almost three meters high ##.
And this was built by de ##posit ##ing artificial sand ##stone layer upon layer in layers of about five millimeter ##s to 10 mm in thick ##ness - ##- slowly growing this structure ##.
This was created by an architectural firm called Shi ##ro ##.
And you can actually walk into it ##.
And on the other end of the spectrum ##, this is a micro ##stru ##cture ##.
It ##' ##s created de ##posit ##ing layers of about four micro ##ns ##.
So really the resolution is quite in ##cre ##dible ##.
The detail that you can get today is quite ama ##zing ##.
So who ##' ##s using it ##?
Typ ##ically ##, because we can create products very rapidly ##, it ##' ##s been used by product designers ##, or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or rei ##tera ##te a design ##.
And actually what ##' ##s quite ama ##zing about this technology as well is that you can create be ##sp ##oke products en masse ##.
